        <dc:title>An investigation into semi-automated 3D city modelling</dc:title>

        <dc:subject>TA 501 Surveying</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Creating three dimensional digital representations of urban areas, also known as 3D city modelling, is essential in many applications, such as urban planning, radio frequency signal propagation, flight simulation and vehicle navigation, which are of increasing importance in modern society urban centres.&#xD;
The main aim of the thesis is the development of a semi-automated, innovative workflow for creating 3D city models using aerial photographs and LiDAR data collected from various airborne sensors. The complexity of this aim necessitates the development of an efficient and reliable way to progress from manually intensive operations to an increased level of automation. The proposed methodology exploits the combination of different datasets, also known as data fusion, to achieve reliable results in different study areas. Data fusion techniques are used to combine linear features, extracted from aerial photographs, with either LiDAR data or any other source available including Very Dense Digital Surface Models (VDDSMs).&#xD;
The research proposes a method which employs a semi automated technique for 3D city modelling by fusing LiDAR if available or VDDSMs with 3D linear features extracted from stereo pairs of photographs. The building detection and the generation of the building footprint is performed with the use of a plane fitting algorithm on the LiDAR or VDDSMs using conditions based on the slope of the roofs and the minimum size of the buildings. The initial building footprint is subsequently generalized using a simplification algorithm that enhances the orthogonality between the individual linear segments within a defined tolerance. The final refinement of the building outline is performed for each linear segment using the filtered stereo matched points with a least squares estimation.&#xD;
The digital reconstruction of the roof shapes is performed by implementing a least squares-plane fitting algorithm on the classified VDDSMs, which is restricted by the building outlines, the minimum size of the planes and the maximum height tolerance between adjacent 3D points. Subsequently neighbouring planes are merged using Boolean operations for generation of solid features. The results indicate very detailed building models. Various roof details such as dormers and chimneys are successfully reconstructed in most cases.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>A supplier review system as part of the government procurement system for China</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Zhang, Xinglin</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>KM Asia</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>A supplier review system can play a significant role in ensuring the enforcement of procurement rules through its deterrent and redress effects. This thesis aims at providing a critical analysis of the current Chinese supplier review system and identifying and evaluating options for improvement of the Chinese system, based on the analysis of provisions on supplier review contained in the UNCITRAL Model Law on Procurement, the GPA, the EU Remedies Directives and APEC Non-Binding Principles on Government Procurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis first discusses key characteristics of national supplier review system, concerning forum for review, standing and procedures, and the remedies, provided in the Model Law and the other three international instruments; and then examines these main aspects of the current Chinese supplier review system. After critically analysing the current Chinese system, it has been found there are a number of important deficiencies in this system, in particular, there is uncertainty over the forum for review, the whole dispute resolution process can be quite lengthy and the available remedies are ineffective. These problems have hampered the effectiveness of the system and made it inconsistent with the international standards which may soon apply or currently actually apply to China, namely the GPA and APEC NBPs. &#xD;
&#xD;
To make the Chinese supplier review system truly effective and also comply with the existing/forthcoming international obligations, the author recommends reforms that aim to be effective yet capable of realistic achievement and also workable in the particular context of Chinese circumstances and the existing position in China. These include providing a unified supplier review system to all complaints regarding government procurement process, improving the current sequential tiered review system, revising the current provisions on standing and the time limit for initiation, offering clear rules on remedies and deleting unreasonable sanctions on the complaining supplier. &#xD;

        <dc:title>The development and application of biological models for evaluation of direct nose-to-brain drug delivery systems</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Mistry, Alpesh</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>RS Pharmacy and materia medica</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The olfactory neuroepithelium is the only part of the central nervous system that is exposed directly to the external environment. Therefore, it is the only non-invasive drug delivery route to the brain. Surface modification of PS nanoparticles with chitosan C-PS), polysorbate 80 (P80-PS) and polysorbate 80+FCS (P80-FCS-PS) changed the toxicity and distribution of these nanoparticles in olfactory mucosae. In addition, a reduction in nanoparticle diameter from 200nm to 20nm increased nanoparticle mucosal penetration and possibly also their cellular toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
In vitro vertical Franz diffusion chamber and in vivo mouse models were adapted to investigate the transport of nanoparticles via the olfactory system. For the in vitro model, preliminary studies found that olfactory epithelium lined the caudal portion of the dorsal nasal turbinate in the porcine nasal cavity. To ensure the scientific validity of the diffusion chamber studies, it was necessary to prove that the experimental procedures themselves (without the addition of nanoparticles) had no effect on the mounted tissue. Therefore, viability and cellular morphology of the dissected olfactory epithelia were assessed prior to application of nanoparticles to tissues. Alamar Blue&#xE2;&#x201E;&#xA2; viability and histological findings showed that the diffusion chamber experiment did not affect the olfactory tissue when compared to samples that were not mounted on the apparatus. Citrate buffer (pH6.0) had significantly reduced the viability (PD, Isc and Alamar Blue&#xE2;&#x201E;&#xA2;) of the porcine olfactory epithelium compared to SNS buffer (pH7.4) but it did not kill it. Citrate buffer may have depleted the mucosal pH gradient in the epithelium. Overall both SNS buffered and citrate buffered porcine olfactory epithelia were suitable for nanoparticle transport studies in the vertical Franz diffusion cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
The in vitro and in vivo biological models showed surface modification had changed the distribution of nanoparticles within the epithelia. There was good agreement between particle losses from donor chamber, fluorescence microscopy images and stereology results that C-PS particles adhered to extracellular mucus to a greater extent compared to PS and P80-FCS-PS. P80-PS nanoparticles were taken into the nasal epithelial cells to a greater extent than C-PS. Nanoparticles were not transported to the receiver chamber in vitro or the olfactory bulbs in vivo. The size of the nanoparticles was also important. Fluorescence microscopy and stereology showed that greater numbers of 100nm PS and 100nm P80-FCS-PS were taken up into mouse olfactory epithelial cells compared to 200nm diameter equivalents. Larger particles may not have penetrated mucus as effectively as smaller ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
Bright field microscopy images of olfactory epithelia dismounted from the diffusion chamber apparatus after transport study with C-PS nanoparticles showed that these particles caused the greatest amount of cellular damage compared to PS, P80-PS and P80-FCS-PS systems. Greater damage was observed for progressively smaller particles. For example, 20nm C-PS may have accessed subcellular organelles such as mitochondria to cause cell death by oxidative stress. However, similar findings in the mouse model were not observed. It was hypothesised that, unlike the in vitro model, the mouse model may have been able to maintain a pH gradient across the mucous layer by neutralising the acidity from the citrate buffer using blood borne HCO3- ions. This would protect the epithelial cells by causing C-PS to aggregate in the mucus thereby preventing them from accessing the epithelial cells.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>A systems approach to assess the redevelopment options for urban brownfield sites</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Leney, Anthony D.</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>HD Industries. Land use. Labor</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The problem addressed is: How can an appropriate redevelopment option for an urban brownfield site be determined?&#xD;
&#xD;
A systems-based approach, Brownfield REMIT/RESPONSE (BRR), to assess the impact of brownfield redevelopment on the surrounding urban area has been developed. This utilises REMIT/RESPONSE combined with urban theory to develop a dynamic model of the generic impact of brownfield redevelopment that when combined with site-specific information can be used to identify and compare the impact of different redevelopment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
The development of a roadmap of the brownfield redevelopment process identified when decisions about the redevelopment option of a brownfield site were likely to be taken and was used to produce a list factors relating to the brownfield site and the surrounding urban area that could affect this decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
A review of the National Garden Festivals identified that the most important factor in delivering an appropriate redevelopment option where a site is initially redeveloped for a temporary event is the planning component of the characterisation, planning and design stage of the brownfield redevelopment process. An assessment of urban models determined that it was not possible to predict the impact of brownfield redevelopment on urban area as a means of comparing alternative redevelopment options. Therefore, it was necessary to develop a new tool to compare alternative redevelopment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
The developed tool, BRR, provides a means to assess the redevelopment options of brownfield sites in an integrated and systematic manner that considers the social, economic and environmental aspects of the redevelopment. To demonstrate that BRR could be applied to assess brownfield redevelopment it was applied to develop a systematic objective-based model of the redevelopment of the Radford site. By analysing the effects of policy identified within the model it was identified that, at the Radford site, there was no policy requirement to assess the sustainability of the redevelopment option chosen and that conflicting policies delayed the redevelopment of the site.&#xD;
BRR was applied to assess the proposed redevelopment options at three sites. At the first two sites, a single option was assessed to determine if it was appropriate. At the Shaw and Marvin site it was shown that the redevelopment option was appropriate and at the Willoughby Garages site it was shown that whilst the redevelopment&#xD;
option was not inappropriate, it was likely that a more beneficial option could be identified. At the third site, Basford gasworks three redevelopment options were compared and it was determined that industrial and commercial units were the most appropriate of three options.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Re-placing regionalisms: Atlantic Canada in 21st century narratives</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Smith, Will</dc:creator>

        <dc:subject>PN1993 Motion pictures</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Though traditionally mapped as a margin, Stephen Henighan has argued that 'By the late 1990s it seemed that only writers from Atlantic Canada - Wayne Johnston, Alistair MacLeod, David Adams Richards - still wrote Canadian novels; this may help explain the surge in these writers popularity.' This duality of being Canadian and exploring a regional social identity, in context with an evolving global community, is navigated by contemporary Atlantic Canadian film and literature alike. Contemporary narratives challenge both stereotypes and cultural marginalisation by constructing 'authentic' representations of place, without recourse to overt commodification. The strategies developed in negotiating past ideas of regional identity constitute a contemporary regional imaginary. Contemporary narratives conjure a fluid idea of regional experience, open to multiple identity claims and forces of globalisation. &#xD;
&#xD;
The narratives this thesis examines are both literary and film. In literature the study covers Lynn Coady's Victory Meat anthology from 2003, and longer texts from some of the volume's contributors, Lisa Moore's Alligator (2005), Christy Ann Conlin's Heave (2002), Michael Winter's This All Happened (2000) and The Big Why (2004). The study also addresses the 2006 Commonwealth Film Festival award winner Whole New Thing directed by Amnon Buchbinder. Each of these narratives suggests a different engagement with the tropes of regional identity. The following study identifies how the region is represented and re-placed, as the site of interpretation, the place of performance and an arena of everyday practices. Although it is often contended that Atlantic Canada is not a viable field of study, this thesis shows that Atlantic Canadian contemporary creative imaginaries react to the same pressures and perceptions.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Numerical modelling of the effect of fretting wear on fretting fatigue</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Madge, Jason John</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>TA Engineering (General). Civil engineering (General)</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>This thesis reports the development of a method for predicting the fretting fatigue life of a system which takes into consideration the material removed as a result of fretting wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
The first implementation is based on a critical plane, multiaxial fatigue model and a damage accumulation framework. The model is applied to both &#x2018;cylinder on flat&#x2019; and &#x2018;rounded edge punch on flat&#x2019; geometries, for which experimental data from the literature is used for comparison..&#xD;
&#xD;
The method is able to predict a number of key experimentally observed phenomena, which existing approaches are unable to do. The dependence of fretting fatigue life on slip amplitude is captured demonstrating a critical range of slip amplitudes, relating to the partial slip regime, for which a minimum in life is predicted. The method is also shown to predict the occurrence of cracking at specific locations in the slip region. The method indicates that these phenomena are dependent on the relative rates of wear and fatigue damage occurring across the contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
The second implementation treats the nucleation and propagation fatigue phases separately. The fatigue model adopted above is reformulated to serve as a nucleation model, whilst the crack propagation phase is based on a fracture mechanics perspective. The method is used to study the effect of wear on both the propagation and nucleation aspects of fatigue. The method is also employed to investigate the role of fretting wear in fretting fatigue crack arrest.&#xD;

        <dc:subject>LC1001 Types of education, including humanistic, vocational, professional</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>This thesis investigates the influence of regional culture on young people's decision making when considering post-sixteen educational choices and directions from school. The data is provided by life story interviews with young people - aged eighteen to twenty years, 'born and bred' in Lincolnshire - who have followed four pathways from compulsory education. Within the context of Lincolnshire the influence of rurality is a major element of regional culture and figures in much of the discussion and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
The work of Pierre Bourdieu in defining culture through field and habitus is used as a theoretical perspective in the data analysis and conclusions. The research highlights the continued importance of family and community habitus in the decision-making processes of young people. The interviews are used to consider the relative field positions important in defining individuals' post-sixteen pathways. The nature of rurality as a social construct rather than simply a reflection of physical geography is discussed and conclusions offered as to its possible effect on preferred post-sixteen pathways. The relative importance given to physical and social characteristics of rurality is used to construct a series of cultural indicators for rural communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
The data would support the conclusion that new initiatives designed to increase participation rates in post-sixteen education are having some effect, but only among those young people predisposed through family habitus to continuing education. Those young people whose family habitus most closely coincides with pedagogic authority are most likely to operate comfortably within the educational habitus and hence continue with formal education beyond sixteen.&#xD;
&#xD;
The thesis suggests the real differences in habitus between urban and rural communities requires a shift in the policy debate if rural people are to participate fully in the notion of lifelong learning.&#xD;

        <dc:description>The focus of this study is on guided fantasy; a technique which is increasingly used in educational and psychotherapeutic situations. The potential coherence of guided fantasy is examined by establishing the degree to which the elements of various guided fantasy experiences are perceived as being similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
Two forms of guided faintasy are examined:&#xD;
(a) A situation in which an individual subject is relaxed, with closed eyes and he is given a theme to begin the fantasy journey. The subject describes the fantasy aloud and the experimenter acts as a guide, using a non-directive mode of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
(b) A group form of guided fantasy in which the subjects are relaxed, with closed eyes, and a script of the fantasy journey, with long pauses, is read to the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
The elements of fantasy were evaluated using the subjects' personal constructs, except in the case of one group study where Cattell's sixteen personality factors were used. All of the individual subjects, the two group analyses and the individuals within the groups produced significant organizations of fantasy experience. This provides a basis for discussion of guided fantasy in terms of its meaningful structure. This is relevant to the consideration of interpretation, the possibility of sub-personalities and the ideas of overdetermination and condensation.&#xD;

        <dc:title>The application of atomic force microscopy in the surface analysis of polymeric biomaterials </dc:title>

        <dc:description>When a polymeric biomaterial is employed within a living system an interface is created between the solid surface of the polymer and an aqueous environment. The processes that occur at this interface will determine if the biomaterial is accepted by the patient and often will determine if the specific function of the biomaterial can be achieved. Increasingly, novel biomaterials are expected to perform more sophisticated functions and, therefore, their surfaces must be designed to realize precise interfacial events, such as specific interactions with proteins and cells or controlled biodegradation.&#xD;
&#xD;
To design polymeric biomaterials with specific surface properties it is necessary to develop surface analytical techniques that can accurately characterize these properties. The work described in this thesis has aimed to investigate the potential contribution of the atomic force microscope (AFM) to this characterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
The advantages of utilizing AFM in the study of polymeric biomaterials lie in the ability of the instrument to visualize insulating surfaces at a high resolution within a variety of environments, including gaseous and liquid environments. Therefore, it is possible to image the nanoscopic organization of polymeric biomaterials within environmental conditions that are similar to the conditions encountered within living systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
Initial studies have concentrated on imaging the surface morphology of poly(ethylane oxide) (PEG) samples in air. These studies highlighted the high resolution capability of the AFM on untreated polymer samples. On sphemlitic samples, the AFM has visualized the lamellar organization of crystalline fibres. These lamellae had widths of between 10 and 30 nm and height variations of less than 15 nm. The ability of the AFM to resolve such structures, without the introduction of an etching or staining procedure required by transmission electron microscopy, relies on the sensitivity of the instrument to changes in the height of the topography. This sensitivity has been further utilized to image polymer strands with recorded widths of 8 nm. This width represents an overestimation of the true dimensions of the strand due to the finite size of the AFM probe apex and using the circular probe model it has been calculated that the strands have true widths of less than 0.8 nm, indicating that they are composed of one or two PEG molecules. Further studies on PEG have demonstrated the ability to control polymer surface morphology through changes in the temperature of thin film preparation and changes in the method of polymer solution deposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
The work on PEG surface morphology acts as the foundation for the remaining studies, which employ the AFM to study biodegradable polymers within aqueous environments. This in situ application of the AFM has recorded the changes in surface morphology that occur to poly(sebacic anhydride) (PSA) during surface erosion in alkaline conditions. These studies have visualized the preferential degradation of amorphous regions of sphemlites over the crystalline fibres for solution cast and melt-crystallized samples. It has been found that rapid cooling during the solidification of PSA increases the amount of amorphous material at the surface of samples. However, once this outer layer has been eroded the underlying material is dominated by crystalline fibres. In situ AFM studies have also demonstrated the pH dependence of the rate of PSA surface erosion.&#xD;
&#xD;
The AFM techniques developed to visualize the evolution of surface changes during PSA erosion have then been employed to investigate the degradation of immiscible blends of PSA and the polyester poly(DL-lactic acid) (PLA). PLA degrades at a slower rate than PSA and therefore, as these blends eroded the surface morphology became dominated by PLA, revealing the phase separation of the material. For solution cast samples on mica substrates it was found that at high PSA content the PSA formed a continuous network around islands of PLA. However, as the relative content of PLA increased the morphology reversed and the PLA formed the network around islands of PSA.&#xD;
The interest in studying biodegradable polymers is derived from their application in surface eroding drug delivery systems. Having demonstrated the potential of the AFM to visualize dynamic interfacial changes occurring to these polymeric biomaterials, the in situ studies were extended to investigate the release of a model protein drug from a degrading polymer film. The system under investigation was a poly(ortho ester) film containing particles of bovine serum albumin. The AFM visualized the initiation of dissolution of some protein particles within minutes of the exposure of the sample to a pH 6 environment. Other particles, however, displayed retarded dissolution behaviour and did not appear to dissolve until the sample had been exposed to the pH 6 environment for over 1 hour. To assist the interpretation of these studies computational methods of calculating changes in volume during polymer degradation and protein dissolution have been developed on the Genesis II system.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the final experiments of this thesis, the application of a novel combined atomic force microscopy/surface plasmon resonance instrument is described. This instrument allows the simultaneous acquisition of topographical data by the AFM and kinetic data by the surface plasmon resonance instrument (SPR). The instrument is first applied to a simple poly(ortho ester) system to demonstrate that the changes surface morphology and polymer film thickness can be simultaneously monitored. Then, the PSA/PLA blends were re-analysed. This analysis highlighted the synergistic information obtained by the combined AFM/SPR and revealed new data on the relationship between polymer phase separation and biodegradation kinetics.&#xD;

        <dc:title>A randomised controlled trial of occupational therapy for stroke patients not admitted to hospital </dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Walker, Marion Fraser</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>WL Nervous system</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Not all stroke patients are admitted to hospital. The literature indicates that between 22% and 60% of stroke patients remain in the community, often with little or no rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Occupational therapy is commonly used in the treatment of stroke patients and aims to promote recovery through purposeful activity. Several small trials have suggested that this approach may be effective in reducing disability but none has examined the effect of occupational therapy on stroke patients not admitted to hospital. Therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of occupational therapy on the disability and handicap experienced by stroke patients who remain in the community. &#xD;
&#xD;
Patients were recruited to the study from a community stroke register. This register covered a geographical area of Nottingham and Southern Derbyshire, incorporating 73 general practitioner practices, covering 494,000 patients. Patients were included in the study if they fulfilled the WHO definition of stroke and had not been admitted to hospital. Patients were excluded if they lived in a nursing or residential home, could not speak or understand English prior to their stroke or had a previous history of dementia. At one month after stroke patients were assessed on a series of physical and cognitive assessments. Patients were then randomly allocated to a treatment group or a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
Patients allocated to the treatment group received visits from a research occupational therapist for up to five months. The main aim of treatment was independence in personal and extended activities of daily living. Patients were also encouraged to participate in leisure activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
Two hundred and forty patients were notified to the study and of these, 55 patients were excluded. Of the remaining 185 patients, 94 were randomly allocated to the treatment group and 91 to the control group. All baseline assessments and demographic data were well matched between the groups.&#xD;
Twenty-two patients could not be assessed at six months; 13 patients had died during follow up and nine withdrew from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
Significant differences were found between the groups at six months after stroke on the Barthel Index (p=0.002, 95% CI 0 to 1), Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (p=0.009, 95% CI 1 to 4), Rivermead Gross Function (p=0.004, 95% CI 0 to 2), Caregiver Strain Index (p= 0.02, 95% CI 0 to 2) and the London Handicap Scale (p=0.03, 95% CI 0.3 to 13.5). There were no significant differences between the groups on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale. General Health Questionnaire 28 for either the patient or the carer or on the Nottingham Leisure Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
This study demonstrated that occupational therapy significantly reduced the level of disability and handicap experienced by stroke patients who remained in the community and also significantly reduced the strain of the carer.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Dressing after stroke</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Walker, Marion Fraser</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>WL Nervous system</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The literature available indicates that dressing difficulties after stroke are common and persistent. Previous studies have documented dressing ability but none have investigated each individual component of the dressing process using a detailed dressing assessment suitable for stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
The aims of this study were: to develop a dressing assessment (Nottingham Stroke Dressing Assessment) breaking dressing down into its component parts; to identify dressing problems; and to investigate the relationship between dressing ability and physical, perceptual and cognitive disabilities due to stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
A series of 60 male and female stroke patients were assessed on their dressing abilities using the Nottingham Stroke Dressing Assessment on four occasions over their first 14 days after admission to the Nottingham Stroke Unit. During this time patients were also assessed on the Rivermead ADL scale, Rivermead Motor Function and other physical, perceptual and cognitive assessments. The frequency of problems in dressing were determined. The most difficult problems were pulling up trousers, putting shoe on affected foot and pulling up pants. The relation between dressing score and all other assessments was determined using a Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient. There were statistically significant correlations between dressing and activities of daily living, gross motor function, leg and arm function, perception, sensation, language, hand-eye coordination and intelligence. No significant relation was found with apraxia, memory, premorbid IQ or reasoning ability. These results suggest that motor recovery and perceptual abilities are important determinants of dressing ability as has been suggested by previous studies.&#xD;

        <dc:title>An analysis of the influences on the moving and handling practice of diploma student nurses within a medical environment</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Abbott, Michael John</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>WY Nursing</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Anecdotal evidence indicates that in clinical practice diploma student nurses encounter M&amp;H practices that do not always reflect those taught in training and that these influence their own practice. There is little available research evidence that identifies the factors that influence students moving and handling.&#xD;
&#xD;
The aim of the study was to explore the factors influencing the moving and handling practice of student nurses in the practice setting. 24 diploma in nursing students from one centre of a school of nursing participated in the qualitative study. Data was obtained using semi-structured interviews and non-participant observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
The students moving and handling practice was subject to a large number of influences of which the most influential were those of service staff and the associated M&amp;H norms of the clinical area. In the face of experienced staff students felt inferior and powerless and in order to 'fit in' failed to confront established moving and handling norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
Students felt their moving and handling training unrepresentative of clinical practice and were little influenced by it. The predominant influence was the clinical staff's practice of moving and handling.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pre- and post-registration moving and handling training needs to be standardised, integrated and for students should be taught in a way that enables them to apply their learning in the practice setting.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Developing my theory of practice as a teacher-researcher through a case-study of CLIL classroom interaction</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Wiesemes, Rolf</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>LB1024 Teaching</dc:subject>
        <dc:subject>P Philology. Linguistics</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Research by the Nuffield Foundation (2000) suggests that the teaching and learning of Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) in English secondary schools is in crisis. At the same time, some schools are implementing initiatives intended to raise the status and the quality of MFL learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
One such school is the College du Pare [fictitious name] where in September 1998 the Bilingual Foundation Course (BFC) was introduced. In the BFC, non-linguistic subjects (English, History, Geography, Religious Education and Pastoral and Social Education) were taught to 3 out of 6, Year 7 classes (11-12 year olds) through French. From September 1998 until July 2000, I was one of the teachers in the BFC and conducted my research for this thesis by developing my theory of practice through case study. The data served as the basis for my understanding of CLIL classroom interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
In order to present my research framework, I illustrate in Chapters 1-2 how I have come to consider the key features of my theory of practice (van Lier, 1994, 1996) as being meaningful, focused and pragmatic. In Chapters 3-4, I describe my theory of practice of CLIL classroom interaction by jointly examining CLIL theories and my classroom practices. This allows me to develop a 'support and challenges' framework, which leads to learners' noticing and 'performance' in the foreign language.&#xD;
&#xD;
On the basis of my research, I re-examine my arguments in Chapter 5 based on my two main findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
- I suggest that CLIL makes (foreign) language use visible: CLIL allows both the teacher and the learners to become aware of their language use.&#xD;
&#xD;
- I relate this argument to the current situation for MFL teaching and learning in English secondary schools which then leads me to reconsider theory of practice in general.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Investigation of ejector re-compression absorption refrigeration cycle</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Wu, Shenyi</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>TP Chemical technology</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>This thesis describes a theoretical and experimental investigation of the ejector re-compression lithium bromide absorption refrigeration cycle. In this novel cycle, a steam ejector is used to enhance the concentration process by compressing the vapour to a state that it can be used to re-heat the solution from where it was evolved. Since this cycle recovers the heat otherwise wasted in a conventional absorption cycle, the energy performance of the cycle is improved. The theoretical study shows that the improvement of the efficiency is proportional to the performance of the steam ejector. A COP of 1.013 was achieved from the experiment in this investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
The novel cycle does not only improve the energy efficiency but also avoids the corrosion that will happen when high temperature heat sources are used to drive a lithium bromide absorption refrigerator. The steam ejector in the novel cycle acts as an efficient temperature converter in acceptance of different temperature heat sources, which reduces the energy loss when the temperature difference between the solution and the heat source is big. Therefore, the solution temperature can be set to a low level while the heat source temperature is high. This is significant to avoid the corrosion of lithium bromide solution at high temperature. Furthermore, the construction of the machine based on the novel cycle is simpler than that based on the conventional double-effect cycle. This refrigerator will be more reliable and have a lower initial capital cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
The cycle was investigated comprehensively in this thesis. In the theoretical study, a mathematical model for this novel cycle was established. The theoretical study reveals the operation characteristics and the factors that affect the energy efficiency of the cycle as well as how to design a refrigerator based on the novel cycle. In the experimental study, a concept-approved refrigerator was manufactured and tested. The part-load performance of the novel cycle was investigated from the experiment. The theoretical results had a good agreement with the experimental ones.&#xD;

        <dc:description>This thesis is a study of morality in marketing, focusing specifically on marketing in relation to the natural environment, i.e. green marketing. An interdisciplinary approach is adopted, incorporating a broad range of literature pertaining to issues of morality in marketing. The contribution of this literature is analysed, and the green marketing literature is assessed according to the moral perspectives applied. The need for greater insight into the development and communication of moral meanings in the marketing process is thus identified, and an organization culture perspective is articulated by which to effect this in the context of green marketing. This cultural perspective is then used as the basis for the exploratory, empirical research which forms the core of the thesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
Utilising an interpretive, comparative case study approach, and following a grounded theory methodology, data is presented to illustrate the content and process of green marketing strategies and tactics in three types of organizations - conventional, social mission, and business-NGO collaboration. The moral tone of these projects is examined and the cultural dynamics which attend the greening process are explored in order to reveal the moral meanings subsequently communicated and legitimised within and around the case organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
Consequently, a picture of contemporary green marketing practice grounded in empirical data is developed, and the theoretical implications discussed. Moreover, the proposition is advanced that there is a tendency in corporations for green marketing to be accompanied by a process of 'amoralization', i.e. a removal of moral meaning and significance for the natural environment. Specific actor roles and processes of amoralization are set out, and potential explanations advanced. The implications and wider ramifications of these findings are discussed, and the possibilities for introducing greater moral consciousness and feeling into marketing are discussed. Finally, some management implications and directions for further research are considered.&#xD;

        <dc:title>A sociological study of school transfer and the learning of mathematics</dc:title>

        <dc:description>This research explores the complexities of children's everyday experience, examining the common threads and distinctive textures of the lives of four children on their educational journeys from primary to secondary school. Whilst the classroom focus of the empirical work has remained with the teaching and learning of mathematics, I have retained a wider view on the overlapping social spaces in which these children are located. Hence this thesis is less to do with mathematics per se than it is concerned with the lives of children and their families, friends and teachers. This research was conducted, and this thesis constructed, in parallel to my transition into academia and so what follows narrates part of my own story of transfer and socialisation. The notion of reflexivity, of understanding my position within the research, is central to the methodological and theoretical work of the thesis and so I will begin with an account of how I have come to be doing this research, at this time, in this place.&#xD;
&#xD;
Following that personal preface I proceed to review the literature concerning the transfer from primary to secondary school. This is organised chronologically with the aim of tracing the development of the main themes during the last forty years, as well as identifying what is missing in the literature. This lays the foundations for an exploration of the stubbornly resistant, reproductive mechanisms that work to structure the social and educational experiences of children at transfer. This social structuring is part of what I have termed the learning landscape.&#xD;
&#xD;
Metaphor is a conceptual tool by which we come to understand our world and through the development of a learning landscape metaphor I will theorise the various influences upon the learner of mathematics. This will include a consideration of how government policy, school cultures, family attitudes and so on, affect the learning of mathematics in the classroom. The motivation for such theorisation arises firstly from the supposed failure of educators to ameliorate the problematic aspects of school transfer. Such accusations of teacher failure are made possible by oversimplified, decontextualised theories of the highly complex influences at this educational branching point. The literature reveals that despite decades of research there is still a relative disadvantaging at transfer of those children who come from families with lower capital resources. The second motivation for this research is my deeply held personal concern about poor attitudes to the study and use of mathematics in the UK. The learning landscape metaphor provides some insights into the culturally embedded nature of this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
I have adopted a collective case study approach and made considerable use of the theory of practice developed by the French sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu. Using Bourdieu's tools of habitus, field and capital I have moved to and from the macrosociological 'landscape' to a study of individual and interrelated lives. At the heart of the thesis the theoretical framework sits together with the empirical case studies and although they will be read sequentially they can only be understood together. Following Bourdieu, the theoretical and empirical cannot be separated without the risk of the practice of theorising becoming more central than the theorising of practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
Following the analytic case reports, I develop a model that describes four 'aspects' that describe the critical role played by teachers in children's experience of moving between the two schools. These aspects are teachers' subjective views of children's based upon historical, mathematical attitudinal and capital data. These aspects are used, together with the case reports, to explain the mechanisms whereby social inequality is reinforced and how those children endowed with greater capital are relatively advantaged in the transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, I conclude with a discussion of the current state of the mathematics learning landscape and a reconsideration of whether or not school transfer could ever be described as a "fresh start". In addition, I will discuss how my theoretical perspective explains systemic and individual contributions to processes of resistance and reproduction.&#xD;

        <dc:title>"Pharmacy counselling": a study of the pharmacist/patient encounter using conversation analysis</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Pilnick, Alison</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>RS Pharmacy and materia medica</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Pharmacy as a profession is changing rapidly in the UK. Over recent years, the increased utilization of ready-prepared drugs has led to a decline in the need for the traditional skills of formulation, while computerization has resulted in a situation where much of the routine dispensing work can be undertaken by less qualified personnel. The decline in the traditional aspects of pharmacy has been matched by the emergence of a much greater advisory role. Pharmacy practice researchers have been drawn to support these developments by investigating related areas, but the common factor linking this research is its focus on clinical as opposed to communication issues. Rather than investigating the nature of face-to-face interaction between pharmacists and clients as a topic in itself, researchers instead have been largely concerned with patient/health care system mteractions as a function of drug therapy. Those few studies that have focused exclusively on communication have done so from a quantitative, social psychology framework, thus ignoring the two way, reactive nature of the interaction process.&#xD;
&#xD;
This study, using data collected from patients' and carers' consultations with pharmacists in a hospital paediatric oncology outpatient clinic, uses the sociological methodology of Conversation Analysis (CA) in order to analyze the encounters which take place. In so doing, it aims to shed some light upon what is actually involved in the process of "patient counselling" in this setting. The body of CA literature which considers advice-giving in health care settings provides the starting point for a consideration of the ways in which pharmacists give advice in this setting, and how this is responded to. The aims are thus twofold: to enlarge the methodological resources of PPR, and also to begin an examination of the communicative competencies required of pharmacists in this setting.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Business ownership experience, entrepreneurial behaviour and performance: novice, habitual, serial and portfolio entrepreneurs</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Ucbasaran, Ayse Deniz</dc:creator>

        <dc:description>Recent media reports have drawn attention to entrepreneurs who have successfully owned several businesses. Entrepreneurs who have owned at least two businesses are known as 'habitual entrepreneurs'. However, not all habitual entrepreneurs are consistently successful. Further, studies show that habitual entrepreneurs are heterogeneous. A distinction has been made between portfolio entrepreneurs (i.e., those who own multiple businesses simultaneously) and serial entrepreneurs (i.e., those who have owned multiple businesses sequentially).&#xD;
&#xD;
It has been argued that to really understand entrepreneurship, there is a need to understand habitual entrepreneurs because they have been able to move down the experience curve with respect to the problems and processes of owning a business. If habitual entrepreneurs are distinct from other groups of entrepreneurs such as novice entrepreneurs (particularly in terms of superior performance), then there may be advantages associated with identifying their practices. Practitioners, such as providers of finance, can make sure that the qualities of habitual entrepreneurs are present in the entrepreneurs they choose to find. Policy-makers wanting to maximise the return on their investments may provide financial support to this group. In addition, guided by the knowledge of how habitual entrepreneurs behave, support can be directed to novice entrepreneurs to encourage best practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this study, the theoretical rationale for distinguishing between these groups is provided using human capital theory. Business ownership experience is viewed as one component of an entrepreneur's specific human capital. In particular, it is argued that as a result of their experience, habitual entrepreneurs may have had an opportunity to develop other aspects of their human capital to a greater extent than novice entrepreneurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
Consequently, one objective of the thesis was to identify differences in the human capital profile of habitual and novice entrepreneurs. The results of the study show that while similarities exist, habitual entrepreneurs display different human capital characteristics than novice entrepreneurs. Further, portfolio entrepreneurs also display different human capital characteristics than serial entrepreneurs. The thesis also explored the relationship between business ownership experience and entrepreneurial behaviour as well as performance. The evidence indicates that habitual entrepreneurs do not search for more information than novice entrepreneurs but they do use different sources of information. Further, habitual entrepreneurs (in particular portfolio entrepreneurs) identify and pursue a significantly greater number of opportunities in a given period. Using a variety of entrepreneur and firm-level performance measures, habitual entrepreneurs do not out-perform their novice counterparts. Interestingly, neither those habitual entrepreneur-s who had been consistently successful, nor those who had previously failed, report superior performance to novice entrepreneurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
On the basis of the findings presented in this study, a number of policy suggestions can be made. Unfortunately, as no particular group of entrepreneur was associated with superior performance, the recommendation than financial support be targeted to a certain group could not be made. However, given relationships between other aspects of human capital and performance, some suggestions for support, particularly in terms of training are offered. Given identified differences in the human capital and behavioural profile of novice, habitual, serial and portfolio entrepreneurs, a case for tailored support is made.&#xD;

        <dc:description>Computer technology has rapidly improved over the last few years, with more powerful machines becoming ever smaller and cheaper. The latest growth area is in portable personal computers, providing powerful facilities to the mobile business person. Alongside this development has been the vast improvement to the human computer interface, allowing noncomputer- literate users access to computing facilities. These two aspects are now being combined into a portable computer that can be operated with a stylus, without the need for a keyboard. Handwriting is the obvious method for entering data and cursive script recognition research aims to comprehend unconstrained, natural handwriting.&#xD;
&#xD;
The ORCHiD system described in this thesis recognises connected handwriting collected on-line, in real time, via a digitising pad. After preprocessing, to remove any hardware-related errors, and normalising, the script is segmented and features of each segment measured. A new segmentation method has been developed which appears to be very consistent across a large number of handwriting styles.&#xD;
&#xD;
A statistical template matching algorithm is used to identify the segments. The system allows ambiguous matching, since cursive script is an ambiguous communications medium when taken out of context, and a probability for each match is calculated. These probabilities can be combined across the word to produce a ranked list of possible interpretations of the script word. A fast dictionary lookup routine has been developed enabling the sometimes very large list of possible words to be verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
The ORCHiD system can be trained, if desired, to a particular user. The training routine, however, is automatic since the untrained recognition system is used as the basis for the trained system. There is therefore very little start-up time before the system can be used. A decision-directed training approach is used. Recognition rates for the system vary depending on the consistency of the writing. On average, the untrained system achieved 75% recognition. After some training, average recognition rates of 91% were achieved, with up to 96% observed after further training.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Search for Pseudomonas aeruginosa immune-modulatory but non-inducing agents&#xD;
</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Jadhav, Gopal P.</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QR180 Immunology</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Dysfunctional immunity which is the most common antecedent of immunological diseases is central to the common disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, thyroid disease, type-1 diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune conditions that are leading causes of chronic morbidities and disabilities. The currently employed therapies suffer from serious side effects. For example, steroid therapy, being nonselective is seldom used. Myleotoxicity limits azathioprine while cyclosporine-A (CsA) and FK506 do show myleo-, nephro and neuro-toxicities. Antibody therapies cause immune mediated toxicity. Therefore, the need of developing less toxic and specific immune modulatory agents is a top priority. &#xD;
&#xD;
Recently, Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing signal molecules (QSSMs), N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3O, C12-HSL) and 2-n-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-(1H)-quinolone (PQS) have been found to modulate eukaryotic immune processes via different targets. The structure activity relationship (SAR) study of 3O, C12-HSL by Chhabra et.al, showed that L-homoserine lactone ring, 3-oxo or hydroxyl group and 12 to14-carbons long acyl chain, apparently conferring optimum lipophilicity and flexibility, are important for immune modulation. However, the new analogues including 3O, C12-HSL negated clinical usefulness as these also participated in bacterial quorum-sensing (QS) activity thus promoting bacterial growth. Also analogues with more than 12-carbons alkyl chain could not be explored by in vitro immune assays due to their limited solubility in the solvents employed.  &#xD;
&#xD;
The present study addresses these issues by making further judicial structural changes in the 3O, C12-HSL in order to optimize its immune modulatory activity while losing its intrinsic QS activity. Accordingly, a series of new ring variants, 3-acetoxy, aza, thia, oxa and fluorine substituted analogues were developed. The later were largely confined in the 1, 3-dicarbonyl segment of the 3O, C12-HSL structure in order to modulate the 3-enolic content of the molecule. Also tetramic acid analogue, a non-enzymatic degradative product of 3O, C12-HSL was synthesized. After purity and identity characterization the new analogues were evaluated for their immune modulation (with murine cells proliferation assay), cytotoxicity (with Trypan dye exclusion assay) and auto-inducing or QS activity (with a specifically designed lux bacterial bio-reporter).&#xD;
&#xD;
The splenocyte proliferation assay demonstrated that immune suppression in 4-aza analogues increased with increasing alkyl chain (up to C15) yet without any solubility problems in the standard solvents used. Similar trend was observed when N4 was alkyl substituted (n-propyl, being most potent). At least one of the C2 hydrogens was found to be essential for activity since, difluoro substitution lost activity. Retention of immune suppression by N3-OH and increased potency by N3-NH2 (EC50=0.99 microM) demonstrated that C3=O can be replaced by an appropriate H-bond donor/acceptor groups. Complete loss of activity with 3-thia substitution (3-thia C12-HSL) and then regain of potency by 3-sulfoxide/sulfone derivatives further demonstrated the importance of 3-oxo (suitable H-bond acceptor/donor) in immune suppression. Insertion of oxygen at C4 retained activity but additional oxygen(s) in the side chain yielded analogues that were devoid of immune suppression. Analogue with thiazole ring instead of HSL ring retained activity. In case of hetero ring altered analogues of 3O, 4-aza C12-HSL, almost all retained immune suppressive activities except their oxa analogues. &#xD;
&#xD;
In conclusion, all the above strategies have delivered potent immune modulatory agents yet gratifyingly devoid of QS activity. Some of the most potent and promising non-inducing immune modulatory agents are 3O, 4-aza-C15-HSL (EC50 0.65 microM), 3-NH2-3-aza-C12-HSL (EC50 0.99 microM) and N, N'-dimethyl-2-(3-oxo-4-azadodecanoyl) aminobenzamide (EC50 0.7 microM) and are worthy of further study to be developed as therapeutic agents. &#xD;

        <dc:description>La presente Tesis Doctoral La Exposicion Iberoamericana (EIA) de Sevilla en contexto tiene como hilo conductor la arquitectura como manifestacion cultural de su epoca. De esta manera, el analisis arquitectonico de la EIA pondra de manifiesto, en primer lugar, la influencia de las Exposiciones Universales ensayadas durante el siglo XIX. Estos certamenes demostraron su capacidad de sintesis al encapsular los avances de cada pa&#xED;&#xAD;s, sin olvidar la plasmacion de la identidad nacional a traves de la arquitectura de sus pabellones. La EIA se basara en este modelo para sintetizar no ya los avances tecnologicos o coloniales de Espana y Latinoamerica, sino, por el contrario, las relaciones existentes entre ambas tras las independencias.&#xD;
&#xD;
En segundo lugar, y a traves del analisis de los pabellones de las distintas naciones sera posible discernir que imagen querian mostrar al otro, a Espana, a las otras republicas latinoamericanas, con su participacion en la EIA. La Plaza de America a traves de los estilos Neogotico, Neomudejar y Neoplateresco pondra de manifiesto la influencia de la corriente conservadora panhispanista, que proponia restablecer una suerte de neoimperialismo sobre las excolonias espanolas. Frente a este afan de superioridad cabe destacar como la mayoria de las republicas latinoamericanas prefirieron condensar su identidad en pabellones neobarrocos, en los que la arquitectura se relaciona con la corriente liberal del Panhispanoamericanismo. El mejor ejemplo de esta corriente esta representado en el pabellon de Argentina.&#xD;
Mexico, por su parte, pondra la nota discordante al establecer, con la arquitectura de su pabellon Neoindigena, la independencia total de Espana, y la relevancia de las culturas indigenas a la hora de conformar su identidad nacional. Disenado por Amabilis durante el gobierno de Calles, este pabellon esta inmerso en la corriente del Indigenismo que, a pesar de haberse desarrollado en toda America Latina, tuvo especial pujanza en Mexico. Por ultimo, en la arquitectura de la Plaza de Espana sera posible descubrir, en la eleccion de los estilos arquitectonicos, la necesidad de repensar una nueva identidad para Espana, que habia dejado de ser un imperio para convertirse en una nacion europea de segunda fila.&#xD;
De esta manera, en tercer y ultimo lugar, al analizar los pabellones de la EIA, sera posible comprender las distintas motivaciones que llevaron a los paises participantes a erigir un pabellon permanente en la capital hispalense: bien para fomentar las relaciones entre las naciones hispanas en aras de ser mas fuertes frente al imperialismo de los Estados Unidos; para redescubrir una identidad comun basada en la raza o en la lengua; para fortalecer las relaciones comerciales; o simplemente con la intencion de utilizar la arquitectura como propaganda politica, economica, o incluso tur&#xED;&#xAD;stica. &#xD;

        <dc:description>We study the Hamiltonian dynamics for a system of two colliding point particles coupled to (2+1)-dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant by anchoring the dynamics of the system to its spatial infinity. We reduce the Chern-Simons formulation of the gravitational action, finding the reduced Hamiltonian for three special cases of the particle masses, in a phase space chart coordinatised by the geodesic distance between the two particles and its conjugate momentum. The dimension of the reduced phase space is two. At the threshold of black hole formation, the black hole mass depends linearly on the momentum, in agreement with previous analysis in a holonomy-based phase space chart. We use the reduced action to compute the semiclassical probability amplitude of two particles to tunnel out of the black hole, finding that the imaginary part of the action is equal to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the hole.&#xD;
&#xD;
We also study the form that conformal field theory (CFT) correlation functions take in coset spaces of (2, C). We realise the (2, C) twistor space T in two distinct but equivalent ways, deriving some important facts about this space, and we also give one representation of another coset space B. We examine the form of CFT correlation functions in T, B and two other related spaces using techniques from representation theory and make a number of comments on the twistor transform for T.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Public participation in health: theory, policy and practice in user involvement in cancer-genetics pilots</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Martin, Graham Paul</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>RA 421 Public health. Hygiene. Preventive Medicine</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Public participation is an increasingly prominent policy in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.  This thesis locates one example of participation within wider debates about the constitution of contemporary society, changing welfare-state governance, and the challenges of operationalizing such initiatives.  It relates the particularities of this case to practical, policy and theoretical questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
The thesis begins by considering the rise of participation in historical context, relating its aims to social-theoretical commentaries on late-modern society.  This framework informs an examination of rationales for participation, an analysis of policy discourses on public involvement in health, and consideration of the challenges of making participation happen.&#xD;
&#xD;
The remainder of the thesis presents the results of an empirical study of one example of participation: service-user involvement in a programme of pilot cancer-genetics services, managed by the third-sector organization Macmillan Cancer Support.  Using interview, observational and documentary data collected over a three-year period, it offers a longitudinal perspective on the practice of involvement, drawing on various actors&#x2019; perspectives.  Considered over five empirical chapters are competing rationales for involvement put forward by different groups of actors, the micro-processes of involvement, and the varied outcomes of negotiations across the seven pilots studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
In reconciling the theoretical and policy literatures with empirical findings, the thesis highlights certain tensions.  Policy-level ambiguities permit the coexistence of multiple discourses about the purpose of involvement, the identity of those involved, and the influence it should command, resulting in conflict as participation is put into practice.  Policies designed to avoid directiveness and facilitate local discretion create dilemmas for those charged with implementation, especially third-sector organizations whose intermediary role means they must reconcile divergent views of diverse stakeholders in participation practice.  The result is a situation where pragmatic negotiations take precedence over any theoretical or normative vision for participation in determining its remit, scope and influence.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Modelling and active control of the Vacuum Infusion Process for composites manufacture</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Modi, Dhiren</dc:creator>

        <dc:description>Vacuum infusion technology, even though first reported more than 50 years ago, was not popular for mainstream fibre reinforced polymer composites manufacturing until recently. Its present-day popularity is due to the increasing emphasis on the manufacturing cost as well as environmental and health concerns. As a result, novel processes such as Vacuum Infusion (VI) and Seemans' Composite Resin Injection Moulding Process (SCRIMPTM), employing the same basic technology, have been developed. As latecomers, these processes have not been investigated in detail and there exists a lack of understanding that can undermine the potential improvements in composites manufacturing offered by them. The present work is focused on (i) enhancing the fundamental understanding, and (ii) advancing the processing technology to fully exploit their potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
Limitations of the existing analytical models for fluid flow in VI are explored. Then, improvising upon and extending these models, analytical formulations for the pressure profile and fill-times in rectilinear and radial flow VI processes are developed. An important result from this study is that with increasing reinforcement compliance, the analytical VI pressure profile diverges from the RTM pressure profile. It is found that for rectilinear as well as radial flow processes, the fill-time ratio between equivalent RTM and VI remains constant. Experimental validation for these formulations show that the pressure profile varies with flow progression in both rectilinear and radial flow VI. This leads   to a dynamically changing fill-times ratio between RTM and VI. This dynamic behaviour, which is contrary to analytical predictions, is explained by hypothesising that the compliance characterisation experiments do not replicate the actual events in VI.&#xD;
&#xD;
The issue of process control is also investigated for the VI process. A novel approach, using non-intrusive sensors and real-time flow  simulations, is designed and implemented. The study gives important insights about the controllability of this process. It is found that in VI, due to low driving pressure, an optimum window of opportunity exists for process control. Reinforcements with high permeability give higher flow velocity, while low permeability reinforcements lead to lower flow velocity. Both of these cases lead to a marginal window of opportunity and poor process controllability. For reinforcements that offer good controllability, the control system is able to identify flow deviations and correct them, increasing the process efficiency. </dc:description>

        <dc:title>Investigation into the use of carbon nanofilaments in bone repair applications</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Walter, Daniel Mark</dc:creator>
        <dc:description>The potential of carbon nanofilaments for use in surface modification of implants and as fillers in biocompatible polymer composites was investigated with particular respect to nanofilament size and structure. Carbon nanofilaments were synthesised using chemical vapour deposition or obtained commercially, which provided a range of carbon nanofilament average diameters (13 nm, 134 nm, 142 nm, 155 nm) and structures (platelet, platelet and herringbone, multi-walled nanotubes and vapour-grown nanofibres).&#xD;
&#xD;
The topography and texture of pressed nanofilament substrates was dependent on the nature of the nanofilaments, producing lower micron-scale roughness (Ra) values in the GNF samples (0.5-2.0 &#xB5;m) compared to the MWNT9 and PR19PS substrates (3-4 &#xB5;m), but no significant differences in nanoscale roughness (Ra~150 nm). Human osteoblast response to these substrates was measured. Cells attached and spread to substrates with average nanofilament diameters of 134-155 nm (GNF1, GNF3 and PR19PS) rather than 13 nm (MWNT9) after 90 minutes, but proliferated and differentiated greater on the rougher nanotube samples over 14 days (MWNT9 and PR19PS).&#xD;
&#xD;
Investigation of polymer/carbon nanofilament composites revealed the following. Low concentrations of nanofilament addition into poly(ethyl methacrylate)/tetra furfuryl methacrylate reduced the surface roughness of the polymer (Ra: 1.7 &#xB5;m) by up to 88 % (5 wt% GNF composite), and reduced the storage modulus by 26-68 % of the unfilled polymer (1591 MPa at 37 &#xB0;C). The electrical resistivity of the composites was significantly reduced due to addition of nanofilaments; all samples reaching percolation just above 10 wt% but with different resistivities (~30 &#x3A9;.m at 15 wt% PR19PS, ~10 &#x3A9;.m at 15 wt% GNF and ~0.15 &#x3A9;.m at 15 wt% MWNT9). &#xD;
&#xD;
Human osteoblast attachment on the PEMA/THFMA composites followed trends in roughness, attaching in higher quantities but with less spreading to rougher surfaces (i.e. higher nanofilament concentrations) on all samples except on the 5 wt% MWNT9 composite, which showed high spreading and attachment. This sample also showed the greatest degree of proliferation and differentiation over 14 days of culture. Faradic stimulation of human osteoblasts was investigated by pulsing 10 &#xB5;A of electrical current through 5 wt% MWNT9 composite samples for 6 hours daily over 14 days. There was a slight increase in osteoblast proliferation when stimulating the 5 wt% MWNT9 composite sample with pulsed current compared to unstimulated 5 wt% MWNT9 composite controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
The investigation indicated that the size and nature of carbon nanofilaments affected the surface and bulk properties of pressed nanofilament substrates and nanofilament -PEMA/THFMA composites. Human osteoblasts responded to the size of nanofilaments, especially their diameter, but also with respect to their effect on surface roughness. This was thought to be related to their dimensional similarity to extracellular matrix components in bone tissue. Carbon nanofilaments could therefore potentially be used to texture surfaces and improve bulk properties in biomaterials, particularly in total joint components, bone cements, or tissue engineered scaffolds that could also be electrically stimulated to promote osseointegration. This work also instigates further investigation into the toxicity and reinforcing capabilities of carbon nanofilaments.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Automated self-assembly programming paradigm</dc:title>

        <dc:subject>QA 75 Electronic computers. Computer science</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Self-assembly is a ubiquitous process in nature in which a disordered set of components autonomously assemble into a complex and more ordered structure. Components interact with each other without the presence of central control or external intervention.  Self-assembly is a rapidly growing research topic and has been studied in various domains including nano-science and technology, robotics, micro-electro-mechanical systems, etc. Software self-assembly, on the other hand, has been lacking in research efforts. &#xD;
&#xD;
In this research, I introduced Automated Self-Assembly Programming Paradigm (ASAP&#xB2;), a software self-assembly system whereby a set of human made components are collected in a software repository and later integrated through self-assembly into a specific software architecture. The goal of this research is to push the understanding of software self-assembly and investigate if it can complement current automatic programming approaches such as Genetic Programming.&#xD;
&#xD;
The research begins by studying the behaviour of unguided software self-assembly, a process loosely inspired by ideal gases. The effect of the externally defined environmental parameters are then examined against the diversity of the assembled programs and the time needed for the system to reach its equilibrium. These analysis on software self-assembly then leads to a further investigation by using a particle swarm optimization based embodiment for ASAP&#xB2;. In addition, a family of network structures is studied to examine how various network properties affect the course and result of software self-assembly. The thesis ends by examining software self-assembly far from equilibrium, embedded in assorted network structures.  &#xD;
&#xD;
The main contributions of this thesis are: (1) a literature review on various approaches to the design of self-assembly systems, as well as some popular automatic programming approaches such as Genetic Programming; (2) a software self-assembly model in which software components move and interact with each other and eventually autonomously assemble into programs. This self-assembly process is an entirely new approach to automatic programming; (3) a detailed investigation on how the process and results of software self-assembly can be affected. This is tackled by deploying a variety of embodiments as well as a range of externally defined environmental variables. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study on software self-assembly.  &#xD;

        <dc:title>Finite element investigations on the microstructure of composite materials</dc:title>

        <dc:description>This thesis describes the investigation and development of damage modelling for composites materials at their micro-scale (e.g. fibre, matrix). A damage model for elastic materials, based on a "local" damage approach, has been introduced to predict failure onset and simulate the post-failure behaviour of unidirectional threedimensional representative volume elements (RVE) or unit cells with hexagonal distribution of the fibres over the cross section. The damage model consists of three parts: an elastic model, a failure criterion and the post-failure behaviour. Modifications of von Mises criteria and Maximum Principal Stress criterion have been considered to evaluate failure in the matrix whilst for the fibre in general the Maximum Principal Stress criterion has been used. The damage model has been implemented into the commercial code ABAQUS with subroutines in FORTRAN (UMAT and USDFLD).&#xD;
&#xD;
The material properties in the residual stress analyses are considered temperature dependant to simulate the volumetric contraction during the manufacturing process. Hence, the overall residual stress introduced from curing was determined by considering two ontributions: volume shrinkage of matrix resin from the crosslink polymerization during isothermal curing and thermal contraction of both resin and fibre as a result of cooling from the curing temperature to room temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, three different typologies of 3D unit cells have been investigated. The first kind of micro-model is based on a symmetric distribution of the fibres and the unit cells have two phases, i.e.: matrix and fibre. The second typology of unit cells is still based on a uniform architecture but include a three-dimensional interphase between fibre and matrix. As in real composites at their constituent level fibres are randomly distributed. The mutual distance between fibres represents a critical factor for the ultimate mechanical properties of the micro-composites. Hence the last kind of micro-models account for this non-uniform position of fibres within the RVE although they consists of only two phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
FEM analyses have indicated that predicted damage initiation and evolution are clearly influenced by the presence of residual stresses in all the three different typologies of unit cells analysed. The numerical analyses on the numerical models have proved that, in general, the overall mechanical properties are strongly influenced by the presence of residual stress, fibre volume fraction, fibre distribution and interphasial properties. In particular on transverse tensile loading, residual stresses produces beneficial results in terms of ultimate strength while in the case of longitudinal loading (parallel to the fibres) the matrix, due to the high compressive stress, undergoes a premature failure although.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>This thesis concerns case definitions for work-related stress; that is, the criteria used for the identification of a person as presenting a case. It has its focus on case definitions used as the basis for measurement in two related domains in the British context: large-scale nationally representative workforce surveys and personal injury litigation. Together, these contribute to informing policy and practice on tackling the challenge to occupational health presented by work-related stress.&#xD;

The thesis begins by placing the subject matter in its applied context through a consideration of research and policy imperatives for the development of case definitions for work-related stress. This is followed by a series of studies that employ a systematic review methodology and qualitative methodologies including template analysis and content analysis to explore the use, consequences and development of case definitions used in the two domains of interest. Relationships between both sets of case definitions are explored and implications for research, policy and practice considered. The studies culminate with a critical discourse analytic investigation into the media representation of the case definition used in personal injury litigation for work-related stress and its possible contribution to informing activities on tackling and defining work-related stress. The final chapter brings together the results and conclusions from preceeding chapters. It considers some possible ways forward in the study of case definitions for work-related stress that might contribute to improvements in the occupational health of the nation&#x2019;s workforce.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Quantitative stereophotogrammetric &amp; MRI evaluation of ankle articular cartilage and ankle joint contact characteristics</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Millington, Steven Andrew</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>WE Muscoskeletal system</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Osteoarthritis and degenerative cartilage diseases affect millions of people. Therefore, there is huge interest in developing new therapies to repair, replace and/or regenerate cartilage. This necessitates advances in techniques which make earlier non-invasive diagnosis and objective quantitative evaluations of new therapies possible. Most previous research has focused on the knee and neglected the ankle joint. Hence, the aims of this thesis are to describe and quantify the geometric properties of ankle cartilage, to evaluate joint contact characteristics and develop techniques which allow quantitative measurements to be made in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chapters 3 and 6 describe the application of a high resolution stereophotography system for making highly accurate 3-D geometric models from which quantitative measurements of cartilage parameters and joint area contact can be made. Chapters 4 and 5 report the testing of image analysis algorithms designed to segment cartilage sensitive MR images. Work focused on initially on a semi-automated 2-D segmentation approach and subsequently on a pilot study of 3-D automated segmentation algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
The stereophotographic studies were highly accurately and demonstrated that ankle cartilage thickness is greater than previously reported with the thickest cartilage occurring where cartilage injuries are most commonly seen. Furthermore, joint contact area is larger than previously believed and corresponds to the regions of the thickest cartilage over the talar shoulders. The image analysis studies show that it is possible to accurately and reproducibly segment the thin cartilage layers of the ankle joint using a semi-automated approach. The feasibility of a fully automated 3D method for future clinical use is also shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
In conclusion this thesis presents novel methods for examining ankle articular cartilage in vitro and in vivo, showing that the thickest cartilage occurs in highly curved regions over the shoulders of the talus which correspond to regions of greatest contact. Importantly, the image analysis techniques may be used for future clinical monitoring of patients sustaining cartilage injuries or undergoing cartilage repair therapies.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Studies in carpal tunnel syndrome and cold intolerance</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Salem-Saqer, Khaled</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>WL Nervous system</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) presentation is usually classic but cold-related Raynaud's phenomenon (RP)-like symptoms were described in CTS and more commonly in the injured hand (HI).&#xD;
&#xD;
The work presented in this thesis is divided into two domains; the first aims to extend understanding of the response of the hand to cold in CTS and HI using two processes. [1] The modified cold provocation test (CPT) validated in a group of controls and both primary and secondary (vibration induced) RP subjects. Both hands were immersed in a 12&#xB0;C water bath and the digital temperature recorded every 6 seconds using thermocouples until the digital temperature dropped to 15&#xB0;C. The hands were then removed and allowed to passively re-warm. Baseline temperature (difference between the ambient temperature and the digital temperature), T30sec (temperature gain in the first 30 seconds post-cooling) and T5&#xB0;C (time required to gain 5&#xB0;C) were assessed. [2] Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI), a well-established method for investigating skin microcirculation with an endothelial challenge (facilitated by iontophoresis delivery Sodium Nitroprusside and Acetylcholine). The second domain centred on the management of CTS and in particular outcome assessment of conservative versus surgical treatment in registrar and nurse practitioner CTS clinics in a community hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
Data on 86 controls, 31 primary RP and 59 secondary RP were collected. In the control group the baseline temperature was &gt;6&#xB0;C, which was higher than the primary and secondary RP groups (p-value &lt;0.05, sensitivity 79%, 78%, specificity 43%, 45%, inter-class correlation 53%, 49%); T30sec in secondary RP was &gt;1.8&#xB0;C, which was higher than controls and the primary RP groups (p value &lt;0.001, sensitivity 70%, 71%, specificity 76%, 79%, inter-class correlation 3%, 40%); and T5&#xB0;C in primary RP was &gt;300 seconds, which was longer than that of the controls and secondary RP groups (p-value &lt;0.001, sensitivity 64%, 61%, specificity 70%, 64%, inter-class correlation 70%, 70%); data given for left and right hands respectively. &#xD;
&#xD;
CPT and LDI studies were undertaken on 60 controls and 60 CTS patients pre-operatively and repeated on 40 subjects 5-7 months post-decompression. Post-operatively, the baseline temperature increased by 1.5&#xB0;C (p-value &lt;0.05) in both hands and 2.5&#xB0;C (p-value &lt;0.001) in the median nerve supplied digits, T5oC was reduced in the hands (pre- versus post-operative from 474 to 348 seconds) (p-value 0.06) and from 468 to 273 seconds in the median nerve supplied digits (p-value 0.01). Endothelial dependent and independent control at mean and maximum pre- and post-cooling perfusion was significantly depressed (p value 0.05) post-cold exposure in the control group. LDI limited to the dorsum of the hand identified no significant difference pre- and post-operatively (p-value &gt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
HI subject recruitment was challenging: the absence of a financial incentive and the possible income loss during working days for a young working cohort might have contributed to the poor recruitment. Of the 60 subject targets only 14 recruited and the injury severity varied widely between the recruits; the data gathered through CPT and LDI in this group did not show a significant difference from that collected in controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
CTS management audits on 74 subjects in a nurse-led clinic and 173 subjects in a registrar-led clinic identified a high failure rate of the conservative management (60%) at 6 months follow up in both clinics with unclear success predictors suggesting an extra burden on clinics providing decompression surgery.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Film, history and cultural memory: cinematic representations of Vietnam-era America during the culture wars, 1987-1995</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Burton, James Amos</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>PN1993 Motion pictures</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>My thesis is intended as an intellectual opportunity to take what, I argue, are the "dead ends" of work on the history film in a new direction. I examine cinematic representations of the Vietnam War-era America (1964-1974) produced during the "hot" culture wars (1987-1995). I argue that disagreements among historians and commentators concerning the (mis)representation of history on screen are stymied by either an over-emphasis on factual infidelity, or by dismissal of such concerns as irrelevant. In contradistinction to such approaches, I analyse this group of films in the context of a fluid and negotiated cultural memory. I argue that the consumption of popular films becomes part of a vast intertextual mosaic of remembering and forgetting that is constantly redefining, and reimagining, the past. Representations of history in popular film affect the industrial construction of cultural memory, but Hollywood's intertextual relay of promotion and accompanying wider media discourses also contributes to a climate in which film impacts upon collective memory. I analyse the films firmly within the discursive moment of their production (the culture wars), the circulating promotional discourses that accompany them, and the always already circulating notions of their subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
The introduction outlines my methodological approach and provides an overview of the relationship between the twinned discursive moments. Subsequent chapters focus on representations of returning veterans; representations of the counterculture and the anti-war protest movement; and the subjects foregrounded in the biopics of the period. The fourth chapter examines Forrest Gump as a meta-sixties film and as the fulcrum of my thesis. The final chapter posits that an uplifting version of the sixties has begun to dominate as the most successful type of production in the post-Gump marketplace.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Finite element modelling of the static and dynamic impact behaviour of thermoplastic composite sandwich structures</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Brown, Kevin Anthony</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>TA Engineering (General). Civil engineering (General)</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The overall objective of this study was to develop and validate a predictive modelling methodology for simulating the static and dynamic impact failure response of thermoplastic composite sandwich structures.  The work has primarily focused on sandwich constructions with commingled woven fabric glass/polypropylene composite skins and a crushable polypropylene foam core.&#xD;
&#xD;
The static and high strain rate mechanical properties of the thermoplastic composite skin material have been experimentally characterised.  This investigation showed that the tensile and compressive modulus and strength increased with strain rate while the shear modulus and strength decreased as strain rate increased.  A modelling methodology was developed for predicting damage in the thermoplastic composite using the advanced MAT 162 material model that is implemented in the LS-DYNA explicit finite element code.  An inverse modelling technique for calibrating and validating the MAT 162 damage parameters was developed.  The material model was validated for predictive simulation of the static and crash response of a large scale complex shaped demonstrator thermoplastic composite automotive component.&#xD;
&#xD;
The static and dynamic mechanical properties of the thermoplastic foam core have been experimentally investigated and presented.  This was followed by an experimental investigation and finite element modelling of the failure modes of the thermoplastic composite sandwich under static and dynamic localised indentation and bending loads.  A fracture criteria was implemented in the model to simulate core shear fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
The main contributions to knowledge from this doctoral study are: the static and dynamic characterisation of the mechanical properties and failure modes of the thermoplastic composite and the crushable thermoplastic foam material; development of a validated modelling methodology for predicting damage in thermoplastic composites; and development of a finite element modelling procedure for simulating the static and dynamic impact failure behaviour of thermoplastic composite sandwich structures.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Patterns and instabilities in colloidal nanoparticle assemblies</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Pauliac-Vaujour, Emmanuelle</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QC170 Atomic physics. Constitution and properties of matter</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Colloidal nanoparticles exhibit unusual individual and collective behaviour, often associated with interesting electrical, optical or electromagnetic properties. Thiol-passivated colloidal gold nanoparticles possess in addition a self-organising property, which, when the particles are deposited on a substrate, yields a plethora of fascinating patterns. The conditions of formation of these patterns are investigated, in order to understand the principles of - and gain control over - non-equilibrium self-organisation following drop evaporation.&#xD;
&#xD;
The work presented in this thesis relies mostly on experimental observations, although the results are supported by numerical simulations carried out in the group and based on modified versions of the model developed by Rabani et al. in 2003 [1]. A novel deposition method is introduced, which provides controllable conditions for the occurrence of a wide variety of patterns, including close-packed monolayers of nanoparticles. Pattern and surface characterisation is achieved by combined microscopy techniques - atomic force microscopy (AFM) and real-time contrast-enhanced optical microscopy. The influence on pattern formation of the nanoparticle-solvent-substrate interactions is studied by altering the physical properties of all three components (substrate, solvent and nanoparticles).&#xD;
&#xD;
The experimental set-up allows a meniscus-driven evaporation of the solvent of the nanoparticle solution and enables monitoring of drying front instabilities during the dewetting process. The effects of these instabilities on pattern formation are investigated and highlight a strong contribution of free excess ligands.&#xD;
&#xD;
We have focused on two specific types of patterns which emerge in these experiments : fingering structures and nanoparticle rings. The former are reminiscent of patterns that form in a number of other systems, a process usually called "viscous fingering". A thorough investigation reveals that the mechanism of formation of such patterns involves the combination of specific experimental conditions and at least two different dewetting processes, with different time and length scales. A "pseudo-3D" Monte Carlo model recreates such conditions and yields simulated results which are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with experimental results. On the other hand, nanoparticle rings, although they are a recurrent type of pattern observed in nanoparticle assemblies [2, 3], form according to a mechanism which is not yet fully understood. We show however that wetting properties play a central role in ring formation and growth. As in the case of fingering structures, a narrow range of parameters has been determined, via an exhaustive experimental investigation, which favours the occurrence of nanoparticle rings.&#xD;
&#xD;
For all the nanoparticle assemblies studied in this thesis (close-packed monolayers, fingering structures and nanoparticle rings), the deduction of pattern formation mechanisms from experimental observation (and simulations) relies on the very high degree of reproducibility that it is possible to attain using the combination of a meniscus-driven evaporation, a very fine tuning of experimental conditions and nanoparticle-solvent-substrate interactions, and a systematic cross-characterisation by complementary imaging techniques.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>The impact of social isolation on rat behaviour</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Porkess, Malini Veronica</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>BF Psychology</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder with symptoms including delusions, social withdrawal and cognitive deficits. The cognitive symptoms respond poorly to current antipsychotic medication and in order to develop new treatments it is necessary to model these deficits in animals. Rearing rats in isolation from weaning causes behavioural, cognitive and neurochemical alterations, some of which have relevance to the symptoms of schizophrenia. The work described in this thesis aimed to further characterise the behavioural and cognitive changes found isolation reared rats.&#xD;
&#xD;
After five weeks of isolation rats demonstrated increased locomotor activity in a novel environment and a gender specific impairment in recognition memory. After six weeks of isolation rats developed attenuated prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle. Isolation reared rats did not develop impairments in the attentional set shifting test of behavioural flexibility. However, in a further study isolated rats did show deficits in reversal learning (but not acquisition) in the water maze, which were reversed by the pro-cognitive 5-HT6 antagonist Ro 04-6790. Sub-chronic treatment with aniracetam, a modulator of the AMPA receptor had no effect on fear-related memory impairments seen in passive avoidance but aniracetam-treated isolation reared rats were able to discriminate the novel object.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, following controversial reports linking heavy cannabis use with increased risk of schizophrenia, weanling rats were dosed with a component of cannabis, &#x394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The interactions between isolation rearing and two regimens of THC treatment (low: 4x 2mg/kg and high: 8x 5mg/kg) were observed in adulthood. The low dose of THC had no effect on any behavioural test used. The high dose of THC led to impairments in recognition memory but had no effect on attentional set shifting or prepulse inhibition. High-THC and isolation rearing interacted to improve passive avoidance performance in isolates, but impair social rats. &#xD;
&#xD;
In conclusion, isolation rearing induces varied cognitive deficits which are responsive to nootropic compounds and as such is an important tool in the development of cognition enhancing and antipsychotic drugs.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Towards the built environment linguistics</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Wang, Qi</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>NA Architecture</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>In the history of the built environments theoretical development, the architecture, city and landscape have all been considered as language. Differing from subjects and scholars, various built environment languages have existed, durably or ephemerally. Some stressed the structure of languages and extracted the built environment dictionaries; some emphasized the linguistic characteristics of language and compiled the built environment grammar. They are all great achievements in built environment theory; however, since the connatural difference between the tangible buildings and the intangible spoken &amp; written languages, this concept - the built environment languages - are still esoteric and intricate for the public. &#xD;
&#xD;
Facing this problem, this research intends to probe an integrated built environment language and to uncover the essence and mechanism of the built environment language. Undoubtedly, a comprehensive literature review is the foundation before any further development. Through careful study about both the structural linguistics - semiology system and previous built environment language studies, it is conspicuous that a universal built environment linguistics framework can be established referring to the knowledge of structural linguistics and semiology. Hereinto, firstly the built environment can be looked as a 'langage' that contains the corresponding 'langue' and 'parole' then other binary linguistic concepts, including the "signifier &amp; signified"&#x201A; "isologic sign &amp; non-isologic sign", "syntagmatic axis &amp; systematic axis" and "synchronic aspect &amp; diachronic aspect", can be introduced into this new field. Therefore, based on this framework, not only can the essence and mechanism of built environment linguistics be explained, but also all the previous studies about the languages of architecture, urban planning and landscape can be seamlessly embedded inside. After the theoretical analysis, a discreetly designed simulation test is prepared to verify the practicability of built environment linguistics. Its results can then provide strong support from pragmatic dimension. &#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, the foundation of a theory of universal built environment linguistics can be achieved, but to be same as all other scientific researches, what is completed here is just a beginning rather than an end. &#xD;

        <dc:title>Avoiding regeneration with a matrix converter drive</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Munuswamy, Imayavaramban</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>TK3001 Distribution or transmission of electric power</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Recently, the conventional Matrix Converter has been considered for aerospace applications  because of its compactness in weight and size due to absence of a DC-Link capacitor. In addition the Matrix Converter is capable of producing a variable output voltage with unrestricted input and output frequency. This is useful in aerospace applications which require a wide range of input frequency, sometimes from 360 Hz to 900 Hz. These key features are only obtained from the Matrix Converter without using any large passive components. The Matrix Converter has an inherent regeneration capability. However, the avoidance of the regeneration may be vital in many aerospace applications, such as aircraft surface actuation systems. According to current aircraft power quality specifications regeneration is not allowed and must be dissipated with in the Matrix Converter drive itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis proposes two novel methods which allow regeneration from the Matrix Converter motor drive to be avoided. These are the Bi-Directional Switch (BDS) method and Input Power Clamp (IPC) method. In order to detect regeneration in the Matrix Converter motor drive two techniques are used. These are the Power Comparison (PC) technique and Input Voltage Reference (IVR) technique. Finally, to validate the proposed methods a Matrix Converter has been designed and built with a Regeneration Control Circuit (RCC). Indirect vector control is used to control 4.0 kW Induction Motor. Based on the simulation results and experimental results using the BDS method to avoid regeneration with a Matrix Converter is feasible.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Novel evaporative cooling systems for building applications</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Musa, Mu'azu</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>TH Building construction</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The technology and applications of evaporative cooling to provide human comfort in buildings is not new and has been used in different places based on different methods and materials. Conventional air conditioning systems overshadowed the application of evaporative cooling for buildings despite their ozone layer depletion. Evaporative cooling using porous ceramic evaporators were experimentally investigated. Encouraging results in terms of temperature reduction and cooling effectiveness were reported. In this work also thermoelectric unit was integrated in to the evaporative cooling system containing porous ceramic evaporators. The warm inlet air cooled in the  evaporative cooling chamber was passed over the hot-side fins of the thermoelectric cooling device to act as a better heat sink. Typical test results showed that the cold side temperature of thermoelectric unit was 5Deg.C lower and the hot side was 10Deg.Clower, respectively when operated on the wet and dry porous ceramics evaporative cooling chamber.&#xD;
Direct evaporative cooling is often associated with the rise in relative humidity which may result in uncomfortable feeling due to unwanted increase in moisture. Indirect evaporative cooling offers a solution but still requires&#xD;
improvements in the effectiveness. There is also need for using cheap and readily available materials for the construction, requiring simple fabrication technology without very complex engineering infrastructure. Most widely used common fibrous materials have very limited capillary effect. So a periodic water spray system with an automatic control is required for running the cooler which adds to the power consumption, rise in operation costs as well as construction and operational difficulties. As a compromise using horizontal arrangement was considered. Use of pump for supplying water required to moisten the evaporative cooling surface was eliminated.&#xD;
The system was constructed and tested under varying temperature, relative humidity and air flow rates. Results showed significant temperature reduction accompanied with acceptable increase in relative humidity. Temperature drop of 6-10Deg.C between the inlet and outlet temperatures of the product or supply air was recorded. Increase in relative humidity of the supply air was 6 - 10% less than the working air. Application of this novel system was demonstrated in the parasol self-cooling arrangement. The fibre tube vaporative cooler has the potential of cooling a building space to the acceptable comfort limits.&#xD;
The application of porous ceramics for building space cooling, integrating the system to be used as a heat sink and the use of horizontal fibre tubes for evaporative cooling are all novel ideas in this field of research. Other novel features also include the ability to minimise energy consumption by eliminating common methods of continuous water circulation. &#xD;

        <dc:subject>TA 357 Fluid mechanics</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>This thesis describes the effects of the 4-lobe swirl-inducing pipe on pressure drops for water, sand-water slurry and carboxymethyl cellulose fluids. The pressure drops were measured for two 4-lobe swirl-inducing pipe combined, one 4-lobe swirl-inducing pipe and without swirl-inducing pipe. The swirling pipe applications were installed before a bend on radius-to-diameter (R/D) ratio of 4. The pressure drops were measured on three different locations, before and after the 4-lobe swirl-inducing pipe, and after the bend.&#xD;
&#xD;
Swirling flow behaviours were observed for sand-water slurry at different concentrations. Reynolds number indicated water and sand-water slurries in turbulent regimes. The sand particles were evenly distributed when induced with swirling flow, which caused less wear effect on a pipe-cross section. Results indicated that the swirl-inducing pipe increased the pressure drop for higher concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
The 4-lobe swirl-inducing pipe caused an increased in pressure drop over horizontal pipe and a reduction in pressure drop over the bend. Results showed that the overall pressure drops across pipe (after swirl and bend) were increased with swirl-inducing pipe.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>The art of dissent from the rhetoric of silence: the terror and promise of Dao and Khora</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Goh, Hui Peng Constance</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>B Philosophy (General)</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>This thesis reworks the idea of Chineseness as a translational point in its exploration of the intricate knot of nothingness, a sublimity which makes Chinese culture irreducible to the postcolonial, postmodern or poststructuralist movements because what the West arrogates from Eastern philosophy or contrariwise is simultaneously an interrogative advancement and a detour to selfsameness. Derrida's deconstructive absence in Chinese writing may be surprising to those acquainted with his eloquence on phonetic writing and the Egyptian hieroglyphs. By (dis)locating the commentaries revolving around Derrida's reticence on Chinese inscriptions, I shall launch the argument from what most have put down merely as a "lack" of knowledge, inverted here to expose the always already missing link between the articulator and reality. Derrida's cryptic remark about Chinese writing as "the testimony of a powerful movement of civilization developing outside of all logocentrism" can be read as a suggestion of a certain parallelism between deconstruction and Eastern philosophy, accidentally encountering in this paper. The signifying dissemination within writing is most advantageous to the reading of dao and khora as synonymous sites and only meeting with a supplementary inversion, an ironic twist, at the divide between the East and the West. This Lacanian knot, a result of the encore of centres, is reconciled provisionally with a deus ex machina, the "parallax view" of Slavoj Zizek, the interpretative (l)ink. As part of the many chiasmic encounters, it is the assertion here that Derrida's rewriting of the Heideggerean Dasein, "There is nothing outside the text", signals the revolutionary aestheticisation of the ontological contours which gives to a replete subjectivity, political or otherwise. Inversely, the ontological disclosure in and through aesthetics provides impetus to epistemology. And the circular relations between aesthetics and existential ethics are that which provides the possibility of reconciliation with alterity, the trace that inevitably keeps reading open. Given that we can relate the ethical only to the contextual, the contingency underlying its very definition discloses an indeterminacy that ensures openness to the future, and, coupled with the readiness to respond to the call of the other, prompts a re-reading as reading irresponsibly. In other words, the semiotic coming-to-be reciprocates the coming-to-be of the human entity. Derrida's silence about Chinese writing may be a gesture to the signifying reticence at the heart of discourse, simultaneously the poetic place and moment, which enables this critical traversal, a wayfaring entailing the bearing of the past so that alterity can be imag(in)ed, the "supernumerary" of both dao and khora, with the disablement of a fixed discursive trajectory.&#xD;

        <dc:description>The focus of this study is a community arts programme, Art in Mind, which is based in an inner-city area of an East Midlands city in the UK and was funded by the government's New Deal for the Communities. The aim of the qualitative research study was to gain understanding of the human processes involved in setting up such a project and to ascertain the subsequent benefits to participants. The research was conducted in two stages: stage one involved semi-structured interviews with seven of the original Art in Mind Steering Group members and stage two comprised interviews with eleven participants who were interviewed up to three times over a one-year period. Sixteen people were interviewed in total. The findings from participants are presented as a case-series. Interviewees included those who subsequently became members of the 'Lost Artists Club', one of the community-based activities that originated within the project and those who engaged with an 'Arts on Prescription' programme. In both stages, a total of 35 qualitative interviews were conducted. &#xD;
&#xD;
The concept of mental health promotion through the arts is examined in the context of national developments to promote social inclusion. The methodological framework for the research is a narrative inquiry and emphasis is given to the stories that are individually and collectively constructed and recounted by the participants. All the data were subject to a narrative analysis, incorporating thematic, event and relational analysis. Individual and collective narratives are presented. &#xD;
&#xD;
Findings from stage one of the research identify the personal motivations of Steering Group members to develop the programme. Findings from stage two of the research reveal that the project facilitated new personal, social and occupational opportunities for participants. Identity claims are strong, as people have re-constructed themselves as artists. Participants enjoy a sense of belonging and social identity with like-minded people.&#xD;

        <dc:description>This thesis aims to describe the ultra-rapid synthesis of a number of important transition metal carbides as well as investigating their reaction mechanisms. 4 binary systems are discussed; Nb-C, Mo-C, Ta-C and W-C, and work carried out on the ternary system, Nb-Ta-C, is also evaluated. Carbide production was investigated from both the oxide and elemental precursors.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ultra-rapid synthesis has been achieved through the development of a reproducible experimental technique and the investigation into a plethora of reaction variables as well as microwave applicators and powers. This resulted in, specifically within the single mode cavity, the completion of the majority of reactions within 20 s. Further development was then built upon the direct relationship observed between phase fraction results (obtained from Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXD) data), in-situ temperature and ex-situ dielectric property measurements; allowing reaction profiles of the various carbides to be mapped, as well as a crucial understanding of the effects of microwave energy on materials at various temperatures. &#xD;
&#xD;
Powder Neutron Diffraction (PND) was also used to evaluate product purity and the C occupancy of the final products, revealing non-stoichiometry which relates directly to the Tc onset observed for the superconducting transition metal carbides. This, in turn, allowed the trends observed for the ternary carbides to be explained, a linear trend does not exist between Tc and C occupancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
In an effort to develop on the understanding of solid state microwave heating, in-situ reaction monitoring techniques were investigated. Through the use of thermal imaging and high speed photography, the W-C system was observed during the crucial initial stages of the reaction process. The information obtained both corroborated previously collected data and allowed a possible reaction mechanism to be alluded to. The observation of localised heating, prior to the beginning of carbide formation, suggests possible high temperatures far exceeding those observed by optical pyrometry. This could well explain the rapid reaction times as well as suggest an interaction mechanism between carbon, an efficient microwave absorber, and tungsten, a low dielectric loss metal.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Joseph E. Levine: showmanship, reputation and industrial practice 1945-1977</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>McKenna, Anthony T.</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>PN1993 Motion pictures</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Joseph E. Levine has been largely neglected by Film Studies, yet he was a uniquely important figure in the US film industry during his lifetime. As an independent producer, distributor and promoter, Levine's influence on the post-War cinematic landscape of the US was wide-ranging and profound. His versatility and multifariousness were unsurpassed during his lifetime and analysis of his abilities, strategies and influence complicates many areas of current film scholarship. &#xD;
&#xD;
Levine was a very prominent figure in the popular press where he was perceived as a master showman. His prominence and hyperbolic style undermines the traditional understanding of the cultural intermediary, a role usually associated with discretion. Levine's conspicuousness led to him becoming an easily identifiable public figure yet, due to his varied output, he resists the notions of branding that are often associated with prominent figures in the film industry.&#xD;
&#xD;
Studies of reputation building strategies are often closely aligned to critical approval, yet Levine never courted critical favour. Although Levine's output catered for many niche tastes, his public image was unabashedly populist. He would, however, utilise the critical adulation bestowed on others to bolster his own reputation as a supporter of talent, providing an ideal case study for the complex political interactions of reputational assessment. &#xD;
&#xD;
As a pioneer of industrial strategy and practice, Levine was hugely influential. He pioneered saturation publicity and opening tactics and was an early advocator of the use of television in movie marketing, and therein he represents a vital missing link in the evolution of blockbuster marketing techniques. He was similarly influential regarding the marketing and distribution of art cinema and, in the 1960s and 1970s, he helped to redefine the role of the independent producer.&#xD;
&#xD;
All these factors combine to make Levine an ideal vantage point for surveying cultural and filmic mores of the post-War US. His career was one of extraordinary contradictions and complexities. An analysis of his career provides a deepening of understanding of film historiography of this era and calls into question many commonly held scholarly assumptions regarding taste cultures, cultural boundaries and the supposed demarcation between independent and major studio film production.&#xD;

        <dc:description>The recent work of D. H. Green and others on the benefits of combining linguistic, archaeological and historical evidence has highlighted the importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration to early medieval studies. In this context, the Whittlewood Project (WP) lays important foundations for future projects, both in the UK and elsewhere, which seek to understand local settings in greater depth than any single discipline could permit.&#xD;
&#xD;
The WP is a multi-disciplinary project, encompassing not only the research and analysis in this thesis but also the surveys and findings conducted by Dr Richard Jones (archaeologist) and Dr Mark Page (historian), amongst other scholars. The Project focuses on twelve parishes which straddle the county boundary between Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire. The general aim is to build a picture of its medieval setting, with particular interest in the chronology of medieval settlement formation and subsequent changes in the way that communities responded to and utilised the landscape.&#xD;

Chapter 2 presents a catalogue of Whittlewood place-name material, of which all names recorded before 1600 are analysed. The major place-names of Whittlewood and the surrounding area are investigated in Chapter 3. The band of parishes around Whittlewood adds context to the work solely on Whittlewood parishes; patterns may be further exploited. Chapter 4 draws from the minor names in this catalogue, weaving together the findings from the archaeological and historical surveys with those of place-names. This thesis provides a framework that can be used to aid future onomastic research projects with a cross-disciplinary focus.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>The use of learning styles in adaptive hypermedia</dc:title>

        <dc:description>Computer-based learning has become a common phenomenon in the modern age. Many distance-learning systems distribute educational resources on the Internet and indeed entire study programmes are now widely available online. Such a large amount of content and information can be intimidating to learners, who may exhibit different individual characteristics, such as variation in goals, interests, motivation and/or learning preferences. This suggests that a uniform approach taken by learning environments to deliver materials and resources to students is not appropriate and that personalisation of such materials/resources should address users' differences to provide a customised learning experience, thus enhancing its effectiveness, lowering drop-out rates and maintaining high student motivation. &#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis addresses the latter issue of learning preferences, specifically investigating learning styles as an adaptation mechanism for personalised computer-based learning. A number of previous studies indicated the positive effect that this kind of adaptation provides, but under closer examination these were not conducted in a scientifically rigorous manner and thus their findings are somewhat limited. &#xD;
&#xD;
This research utilises a quantitative and highly objective approach to investigate visual/verbal and sequential/global learning styles in different user groups. Three user trials were carried out to discover whether there were any benefits to using these learning styles for studying in an adapted environment. &#xD;
&#xD;
Overall, no statistically significant benefits were found and these findings now shed doubt as to whether learning styles are indeed an effective mechanism for personalised learning.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Mapping the underworld: integrated GNSS based positioning and GIS based GNSS simulation&#xD;
</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Taha, Ahmad Adnan Mohammad</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>TD Environmental technology. Sanitary engineering</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The United Kingdom utility services are facing the challenge of "mapping the underworld" over four million kilometres of buried pipes and cables (a combination of water, sewage, gas, electricity and drainage). Having accurately mapped pipes and cables increases the efficiency of street works projects, but many existing pipes and cables were only mapped relative to other topographic map features and to varying levels of accuracy. &#xD;
&#xD;
The aim of this thesis is to research various means of improving the positional accuracy of underground utilities in built-up areas through the use of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), integrated with other positioning systems such as Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) and total stations. The reliability and accuracy of the integrated system is an underpinning issue and this thesis looks at testing both current and future GNSS constellations in a controlled environment at the University of Nottingham campus. GNSS integrated with an INS in the first instance, and integrated with a total-station in the second instance, are tested using a network of established points in urban canyon environments on the campus. Several, new technologies were developed by the author including: Urban Canyon GNSS Simulation (UCGS) - a GIS tool; Multiple Step Integration Technique (MSIT) - a methodology for GNSS/INS data collection and processing; and Continuous Updating Technique (CUPT) - a software for GNSS/total-station integration. &#xD;
&#xD;
The results of different simulations provide evidence that using more than one GNSS constellation will significantly increase the availability of GNSS positions in urban canyon environments. However, position availability using the criteria of 5 or more satellites with a Position Dilution Of Precision (PDOP) value of 6 or less for centimetre level is not guaranteed 100% of the time when using GNSS alone. Considering the results of the integrated GNSS/INS system, the position availability was guaranteed 100% of the time in all environments, but the accuracy is not enough to meet utility service requirements. The best results used GNSS integrated with a total-station and showed that, in this case, position availability to a centimetre level of accuracy can be guaranteed 100% of the time in all environments.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Discrete element modelling of railway ballast</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Lu, Mingfei</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>TF Railroad engineering and operation</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Discrete element modelling has been used to capture the essential mechanical features of railway ballast and gain a better understanding of the mechanical behaviour and mechanisms of degradation under monotonic and cyclic loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
A simple procedure has been developed to generate clumps which resemble real ballast particles.  The influence of clump shape on the heterogeneous stresses within an aggregate was investigated in box test simulations.  More angular clumps lead to greater homogeneity and the interlocking provides a much more realistic load-deformation response.  A simple two-ball clump was used with two additional small balls (asperities) bonded at the surface, to represent a single  particle; it is shown that particle abrasion gives the correct settlement response.&#xD;
&#xD;
A clump formed from ten balls in a tetrahedral shape was used in monotonic and cyclic triaxial test simulations and found to produce the correct response.  The interlocking and breaking of very small asperities which find their way into the voids and carry no load was modelled using weak parallel bonds.  The interlocking and fracture of larger asperities was modelled by bonding eight small balls to the ten-ball clump.  Monotonic tests were performed on triaxial samples under different confining pressures and the results compared with existing experimental data.  Tests were also simulated using uncrushable clumps to highlight the important role of asperity abrasion.  Cyclic triaxial tests were then simulated on the same aggregates under a range of stress conditions and the results compared to existing experimental data for the same simulated ballast.  &#xD;
&#xD;
The clumps are able to capture the behaviour of ballast under different conditions, and asperity abrasion plays an important role in governing strength and volumetric strain under monotonic loading, and on permanent strains under cyclic loading.  The contribution of this thesis is therefore to show that it is possible to model a real granular material under static and cyclic conditions, providing much micro mechanical insight.  &#xD;

        <dc:title>The assessment of functional communication in patients with acquired communication problems: the development of the Derby Functional Communication Scale</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Ditchfield, Jennifer A.</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>RC 321 Neuroscience. Biological psychiatry. Neuropsychiatry</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The Derby Functional Communication Scale (DFCS) was developed to assess functional communication in patients in hospital and rehabilitation settings. The validity of the DFCS and its sensitivity to low mood was also examined.  In this study, correlation analysis was undertaken between DFCS and other existing measures of communication and mood. Assessments took place on local Stroke and Rehabilitation units. Sixteen hospital inpatients with acquired communication problems due to mixed aetiologies were assessed on the DFCS and other measures of communication and mood.  Measures used included the DFCS, Frenchay Aphasia Screening Test (FAST), Edinburgh Functional Communication Profile (EFCP), Speech Questionnaire (SQ) and speech and language therapists (SaLT) ratings of global communication ability were used to assess communication.  The Visual Analogue Mood Scales (VAMS) and the Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire (SADQ) were administered as measures of low mood.  The data indicated that DFCS scores were significantly related to other measures of communication (r = .75-.9, p&lt;.01).  Inter-rater reliability was generally good for the DFCS with the exception of the 'understanding' subscale, where a low correlation between staff and SaLT ratings was found. No significant (p&gt;0.05) correlations between DFCS and measures of mood were found. In conclusion, the DFCS may be used for assessing observable communication skills in patients with acquired communication disorders.  However, further validation and evaluation of the sensitivity to low mood is required. &#xD;

        <dc:title>The social utility of art, 1870-1925: aestheticism and the reading public in the works of Amy Levy and Vernon Lee</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Townley, Sarah R.</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>PR English literature</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Traditionally, our idea of late-19th-century British Aestheticism has been understood as a socially-disengaged cultural movement.  However, as Paul Tucker noted, Walter Pater suggests that aesthetic consumption can be ethically-engaged when informed by a 'scholarly conscience.' The following study is concerned with writers Amy Levy (1861-1889) and Vernon Lee (1856-1935), whose dissatisfaction with the social elitism of the Paterian critic and interest in the public sphere, prompted a re-theorisation of the relationship between art's aesthetic value and its social utility.  Surveying the breadth of each writer's critical and fictional works, I argue that whilst Levy and Lee extend Aestheticism to a broader reading public, the term 'public' is something of a misnomer.  Their oeuvres are not, in principle, open to anyone.  Both well-educated writers, Lee and Levy do not forfeit their intellectual integrity and creative esteem; instead, both mediate between aesthetic perfectionism and social utility. &#xD;
&#xD;
Recently, Nicholas Shrimpton has asserted that: 'Art for Art's Sake is not a mark of triviality,' but instead 'the guarantee of [...] professional and intellectual integrity.' As figures on the outskirts of accepted notions of readership, securing professional and intellectual integrity is an important authorial strategy for both Levy and Lee.  Overall, this study sheds a fresh light on what the term 'New Aestheticism' means: whilst it extends our more traditional definition of Aestheticism-- by enabling us to consider a broader range of socially-marginalised figures as actively participating within it-- this revised definition still regards Aestheticism as a movement that selects and excludes.  &#xD;

        <dc:subject>TH 845 Architectural engineering</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Double Skin Facades (DSFs) have been developed as an alternative technology to improve the thermal performance of conventional fully glazed buildings. Nevertheless, there is little test information on the behaviour and real performance of DSFs. This is specifically the case when the facade has to perform under extreme or moderate summer conditions. The characteristics of thermal overheating of a specific type of DSF with various configurations and its practical control have not been subjected to systematic experimental and computational investigations.  This research which is based on an existent load of knowledge, carried out experiments of a full-scale one-storey laboratory chamber of a selected type of Double Skin Facade in which a comparative analysis of the thermal performance is assessed, CFD simulations of the experimental model and a Field Case Study of an existing building in the United Kingdom is also monitored. The basic thermal behaviour in the facade cavity and adjacent room is investigated by a series of parametric studies and basic flow field investigations. Section models of the DSF chamber and the case building were made and modelled using CFD in order to visualise the thermal and airflow behaviour inside the DSF complementing the experimental and field work. &#xD;
&#xD;
The modelling work has demonstrated the feasibility and versatility of the technique for probing the flow and thermal behaviour of double skin facades. It was found that natural ventilation through the cavity by a series of controlled opening shafts on the upper and lower facade are effective means to reduce DSF overheating. It was also observed that the optical properties of cavity elements, cavity depth size, solar control and the basic operation of the facade are key issues to address in order to prevent overheating and additional heat loads from the facade.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Supporting mobile mixed-reality experiences</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Flintham, Martin</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QA 75 Electronic computers. Computer science</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Mobile mixed-reality experiences mix physical and digital spaces, enabling participants to simultaneously inhabit a shared environment online and on the streets. These experiences take the form of games, educational applications and new forms of performance and art, and engender new opportunities for interaction, collaboration and play. As mobile mixed-reality experiences move out of the laboratory and into more public settings they raise new challenges concerning how to support these experiences in the wild.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis argues that mobile mixed-reality experiences in which artists retain creative control over the content and operation of each experience, particularly those that are deployed as theatrical performances, require dedicated support for content authoring and reactive orchestration tools and paradigms in order to be successfully and robustly operated in public settings. These requirements are examined in detail, drawing on the experience of supporting four publicly toured mobile mixed-reality experiences; Can You See Me Now?, Uncle Roy All Around You, I Like Frank in Adelaide and Savannah, which have provided a platform to practically develop, refine and evaluate new solutions to answer these challenges in the face of presenting the experiences to many thousands of participants over a four year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis presents two significant supporting frameworks. The ColourMaps system enables designers to author location-based content by directly colouring over maps; providing a simple, familiar and yet highly flexible approach to matching location-triggers to complex physical spaces. It provides support for multiple and specialised content layers, and the ability to configure and manage other aspects of an experience, including filtering inaccurate position data and underpinning orchestration tools. Second, the Orchestration framework supports the day-to-day operation of public experiences; providing dedicated control-room tools for monitoring that reveal the content landscape and historical events, intervention and improvisation techniques for steering and shaping each participant's experience as it unfolds both physically and virtually, and processes to manage a constant flow of participants.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Virtual reality for fixture design and assembly</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Li, Qiang</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>TJ Mechanical engineering and machinery</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Due to today's heavy, growing competition environment, manufacturing companies have to develop and employ new emerging technologies to increase productivity, reduce production costs, improve product quality, and shorten lead time. The domain of Virtual Reality (VR) has gained great attention during the past few years and is currently&#xD;
explored for practical uses in various industrial areas e.g. CAD, CAM, CAE, CIM, CAPP and computer simulation etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
Owing to the trend towards reducing lead time and human effort devoted to fixtureplanning, the computerization of fixture design is required. Consequently, computer aided fixture design (CAFD) has become an important role of computer aided design/manufacture (CAD/CAM integration. However, there is very little ongoing research specially focused on using the VR technology as a promising solution to enhance CAFD systems' capability and functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
This thesis reviews the possibility of using interactive Virtual Reality (VR) technology to support the conventional fixture design and assembly process. The trend that the use of VR benefits to fulfil the optimization of fixture design and assembly in VE has been identified and investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
The primary objectives were to develop an interactive VR system entitled Virtual Reality Fixture Design &amp; Assembly System (VFDAS), which will allow fixture designers to complete the entire design process for modular fixtures within the Virtual Environment (VE) for instance: Fixture element selection, fixture layout design, assembly, analysis and so on. The main advantage of VFDAS is that the VR system has the capability of simulating the various physical behaviours for virtual fixture elements according to Newtonian physical laws, which will be taken into account throughout the fixture design and evaluation process. For example: gravity, friction, collision detection, mass, applied force, reaction force and elasticity. Almost the whole fixture design and assembly process is achieved as if in the real physics world, and this provides a promise for computer aided fixture design (CAFD) in the future.&#xD;

The VFDAS system was validated in terms of the collision detection, rendering speed, friction, mass, gravity, applied force, elasticity and toppling. These simulation results are presented and quantified by a series of simple examples to show what the system can achieve and what the limitations are.&#xD;

        <dc:description>Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a versatile pathway of DNA repair that deals with a variety of DNA lesions, such as UV-induced DNA damage and interstrand crosslinks. In bacteria, the UvrABC system carries out NER. In human cells, XPF and XPG are two structure-specific endonucleases that act in NER. XPF is responsible for a 5' incision at the DNA lesion and XPG carries out the 3' incision. In Archaea, the third domain of life, most species have homologues of some eukaryal NER proteins. Interestingly, Haloferax volcanii encodes homologues of both the eukaryotic NER genes (XPF, XPG, XPB and XPD) and bacterial NER genes (uvrA, uvrB, uvrC and uvrD). In this study, the function of XPG, XPF and UvrA in H. volcanii is investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
XPG is related to FEN1, a structure-specific 5' flap endonuclease that acts in Okazaki fragment maturation. H. volcanii  has a single gene homologous to both XPG  and FEN1. The helicase/nuclease hef gene in H. volcanii is the archaeal homologue of human XPF, but also shows homology to Mus81 and FANCM. Mus81 has been found to resolve joint molecules in yeast, while FANCM is required for the repair of interstrand crosslinks in vertebrates. The uvrA gene in H. volcanii is the archaeal homologue of bacterial uvrA, which encodes a protein that plays a vital role in NER at the DNA damage recognition step.&#xD;
&#xD;
This study demonstrates that in H. volcanii, UvrA is involved in the major pathway for repair of UV induced DNA damage. By contrast, Hef and UvrA are involved in two different pathways for the repair of mitomycin C induced DNA crosslinks. Fen1 and Hef have overlapping functions for the repair of DNA cross-links, but not oxidative damage. We also obtain a spontaneous suppressor sfnA, which can suppress the slow growth and MMC sensitivity, but not the UV sensitivity of fen1 deletion mutants.&#xD;
&#xD;
Using plasmid assays, it has been shown that the hef deletion mutant is deficient in accurate end-joining and homologous recombination, including both crossover and non-crossover recombination. In contrast, Fen1 has no significant role in accurate end-joining, but Fen1 may regulate the ratio of non-crossover recombination to crossover recombination. &#xD;

        <dc:title>Scanning probe and optical tweezer investigations of biomolecular interactions</dc:title>

        <dc:subject>QD450 Physical and theoretical chemistry</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>A complex array of intermolecular forces controls the interactions between and within biological molecules. The desire to empirically explore these fundamental forces has led to the development of several biophysical techniques. Of these, the atomic force microscope (AFM) and the optical tweezers have been employed throughout this thesis to monitor the intermolecular forces involved in biomolecular interactions.

The AFM is a well-established force sensing technique capable of measuring biomolecular interactions at a single molecule level. However, its versatility has not been extrapolated to the investigation of a drug-enzyme complex. The energy landscape for the force induced dissociation of the DHFR-methotrexate complex was studied. Revealing an energy barrier to dissociation located ~0.3nm from the bound state.

Unfortunately, the AFM has a limited range of accessible loading rates and in order to profile the complete energy landscape alternative force sensing instrumentation should be considered, for example the BFP and optical tweezers. Thus, this thesis outlines the development and construction of an optical trap capable of measuring intermolecular forces between biomolecules at the single molecule level. To demonstrate the force sensing abilities of the optical set up, proof of principle measurements were performed which investigate the interactions between proteins and polymer surfaces subjected to varying degrees of argon plasma treatment. Complementary data was gained from measurements performed independently by the AFM. Changes in polymer resistance to proteins as a response to changes in polymer surface chemistry were detected utilising both AFM and optical tweezers measurements.

Finally, the AFM and optical tweezers were employed as ultrasensitive biosensors. Single molecule investigations of the antibody-antigen interaction between the cardiac troponin I marker and its complementary antibody, reveals the impact therapeutic concentrations of heparin have up on the association and dissociation of the complex. In the thesis the AFM and optical tweezers independently provide complementary data towards the understanding of biomolecular interactions.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Tunnelling into InAs quantum dots</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Hill, Richard John Allan</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QC501 Electricity and magnetism</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>This thesis describes an experimental study of the electronic properties of semiconductor heterostructure tunnel devices. InAs self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) are incorporated into the barrier layer of a GaAs/AlAs/GaAs tunnel diode. When a voltage, V, is applied across the device, we observe resonant features in the tunnel current, I, whenever an electron state in one of the qds comes into resonance with an occupied electron state in the emitter. We employ an electron state of a single qd as a spectroscopic probe of a two-dimensional electron system (2DES), from the Fermi energy to the subband edge [1]. For magnetic field B applied parallel to the current, we observe peaks in the I(V) characteristics corresponding to the formation of Landau levels in the 2DES. We obtain quantitative information about the energy dependence of the quasiparticle lifetime, Tqp, of the 2DES. We find that Tqp ~ 2.5 hbar=(Ef - E), in contrast with the expectation for a normal Fermi liquid, but in agreement with predictions for a Fermi liquid state of a disordered 2DES. Close to filling factor nu = 1 we observe directly the exchange enhancement of the g factor.

This thesis also describes the design, realisation and measurement of a tunnel diode incorporating InAs QDs and a series of 4 planar electrostatic gates. By applying a bias to the gates, it is possible to selectively inject current into a particular QD. We use magneto-tunnelling spectroscopy to determine the energy levels of the ground and excited state of a single QD, and to map the spatial form of the wave functions of these states [2].

The effect of pressure on the resonant tunnelling of the QDs is also described.

        <dc:title>The integration of CFD and VR methods to assist auxiliary ventilation practice</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Silvester, Stephen</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>TN Mining engineering. Metallurgy</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The current trend towards the adoption of retreat longwall mining methods and the associated rapid development of the access drivages has exacerbated the environmental conditions experienced within these workings. The combined use of roof bolt and continuous miner systems has improved the face advance rate within rapid development drivages. In order to maintain adequate dust and gas control it is essential that the auxiliary ventilation and monitoring systems are correctly installed and maintained.

The causes of many potential environmental hazards experienced within auxiliary ventilated rapid development drivages, are often attributed to a failure by the workforce and supervisory officials to maintain the correct installation, maintenance and operational standards of the ventilation and mining systems. The potential ventilation hazards encountered may include: the failure to deliver the required fresh air quantity and velocity to rapidly dilute and disperse methane gas liberated in the vicinity of the cutting face, or the failure to maintain sufficient exhaust air quantity in the vicinity of the cut to adequately capture dust produced on cutting and loading of the extracted mineral.

Results of recent research studies have demonstrated that validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation models can adequately replicate examples of good and bad ventilation. CFD models may be constructed and solved to examine the relative ventilation benefits produced by alternative mining and auxiliary ventilation configurations. These models enable the practitioner to predict and visualise the velocity, pressure and contaminant fields within an auxiliary ventilated drivage. This research project has developed a prototype educational aid, which animates and visualises these airflow and pollutant dispersion patterns within a Virtual Reality (VR) model. By introducing a pollutant such as methane into the CFD models, the VR simulation highlights regions of potential methane concentration build-up to the trainee. The application also allows the user to select/investigate the environmental consequences of enacting a number of remedial actions.

        <dc:description>Experiments have been performed at high B/T to try to establish the existence and value of an anisotropy temperature (Ta) for pure 3He, and for 6.2% and 0.7% 3He-4He mixtures. The anisotropy of diffusion in dilute Fermi gases as the temperature T goes to zero has been predicted, though experimental evidence for such anisotropy has not been universally accepted.

Finite size effects have required careful analysis of the theory of the cell for the 6.2% mixture. This alters the result as determined by the usual Leggett-Rice formula. Further investigation, beyond the scope of this thesis, is currently underway for the case of pure 3He.

The possibility of using a quartz tuning fork as a viscometer has also been investigated. It is shown that tuning forks can be used field-inpendently above 3 mK in saturated 3He-4He mixtures, and to detect the superfluid A and B-phase transitions in pure 3He. It is strongly suggested from the data that the tuning fork has great potential as a high-field viscometer; however further experiments are required to fully appreciate its useful range, in both normal and superfluids.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Galaxy Clustering in Large Redshift Surveys</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Hawkins, Ed</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QB Astronomy</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>This thesis analyses the large scale distribution of galaxies in two recently completed redshift surveys and develops models to infer estimates of redshift-space distortions. These models demonstrate that coherent infall cannot be neglected in analyses of peculiar velocities as previous works have claimed.

The clustering statistics of the largest infra-red (IR) redshift survey to date, the PSCz, are measured for the whole survey and also for various sub-samples, split by absolute luminosity and colour. It is found that IR selected galaxies are less strongly clustered than optically selected samples. A weak dependence of clustering on IR colour is found, along with a consistent dependence on IR absolute luminosity.

An analysis of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), containing about 220,000 galaxy redshifts, is presented. Detailed, high precision measurements are made of both the redshift- and real-space correlation functions. A comprehensive analysis of the measured 2-d correlation function leads to accurate estimates of the redshift-space distortions, including the infall parameter, beta. This measurement is then combined with other recent works to constrain the matter density of the Universe, omega.

The 2dFGRS is also split by absolute luminosity and spectral type to look for dependence of clustering on these galaxy properties. A strong dependence on both luminosity and spectral type is found.

The 2dF Quasar Redshift Survey (2QZ) is used, along with the 2dFGRS, to look for periodicites in the redshift distributions of QSO's in projected close galaxy-QSO pairs. Recent works have reported such an effect in small samples. No such periodicity is found in the largest, most well defined sample tested to date.

These results are entirely consistent with the current cosmological paradigm of a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant and cold dark matter, and also the notion that the large scale distribution of galaxies depends on galaxy type.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Cold atoms in optical lattices</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Scott, Robin George</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QC170 Atomic physics. Constitution and properties of matter</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>This thesis describes the behaviour of cold atoms in optical lattices. In particular, it explores how transport through the energy bands of the optical lattice can be used to study quantum chaos and Bose-Einstein condensation.

Firstly, this study examines the dynamics of ultra-cold sodium atoms in a one-dimensional optical lattice and a three-dimensional harmonic trap, using both semi-classical and quantum-mechanical analyses. The atoms show mixed stable-chaotic classical dynamics, which originate from the intrinsically quantum-mechanical nature of the energy band.  
The quantised energy levels exhibit Gutzwiller fluctuations, and the wavefunctions are scarred by an unstable periodic orbit. Distinct types of wavefunction are identified and related directly to particular parts of the classical phase space via a Wigner function analysis.

Secondly, this report studies the dynamics of a rubidium Bose-Einstein condensate in a one-dimensional optical lattice and three-dimensional harmonic trap. The condensates are set in motion by displacing the trap and initially follow simple semi-classical paths, shaped by the lowest energy band. Above a critical displacement, the condensate undergoes Bragg reflection, and performs Bloch oscillations. After multiple Bragg reflections, solitons and vortices form which damp the centre-of-mass motion.

Finally, the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices are investigated for different parameter regimes, as realised in recent experiments. The results reveal how the experiments can be understood, and identify regimes in which vortices trigger explosive expansion of the condensate.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Kinematics &amp; stellar populations of nearby bulges</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Falcon Barroso, Jesus</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QB Astronomy</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>In this thesis, we investigate the internal kinematics and stellar populations of a subsample of the bulges of nearby galaxies defined by Balcells &amp; Peletier (1994). To do that we have analysed minor axis spectroscopic data of the sample together with Integral Field observations of one the most interesting galaxies in it (NGC7332).
 
We introduce, for the first time, the use of single-burst stellar population models to obtain stellar velocities, velocity dispersions and higher order Gauss-Hermite moments (h_3, h_4) from galaxy spectra in the near-infrared Ca II triplet region. We detect small-amplitude minor-axis rotation, generally due to inner isophotal twists as a result of slightly triaxial bulges or misaligned inner disks. Velocity dispersion profiles, which extend well into the disk region, show a wide range of slopes. Flattened bulges tend to have shallower velocity dispersion profiles. The inferred similarity of radial velocity dispersion profiles of bulge and disk supports the interpretation of these bulges as thickened disks.
 
We also investigate the position of our sample on the fundamental plane of early-type galaxies. We find that bulges, both in the B and K band, lie close to but slightly below the relation defined by ellipticals and S0s. The most deviant point is NGC7332, whose offset w.r.t the FP cannot be explained by measurement errors. Besides, there are hints that bulges of later morphological type are situated below the other bulges in our sample. The fact that bulges lie so close to the FP of ellipticals and S0s implies that their formation epoch must have been similar to that of cluster Es and S0s.
 
We then proceed to present measurements of near-IR Ca triplet (CaT, CaT*), Paschen (PaT) and Magnesium (MgI) indices for the same sample. We find that CaT* decreases with central velocity dispersion (sigma) with small scatter, unlike other metal indices that generally increase. Our result shows that the CaT* - sigma relation is independent of galaxy type from ellipticals to intermediate-type spirals.
 
Finally we have made use of SAURON observations to unravel the origin of peculiar features in the S0 galaxy NGC7332. We have discovered a Kinematically Decoupled Core, found kinematic evidence for a central disk and mapped a rather disturbed gas distribution counter-rotating w.r.t the stellar body of the galaxy. 2D stellar populations maps reveal   that NGC7332 is young everywhere. The fact that we see gas inflow now, together with many features indicates that there must have been gas infall for Gyrs in a row, leading to a continuum formation of this galaxy.</dc:description>

        <dc:subject>TN Mining engineering. Metallurgy</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>This thesis applies Smoluchowski's coagulation-fragmentation
equations to model the mechanical alloying process.  Mechanisms operating during the milling process are reviewed.  In the first instance, models are developed that predict the size distribution of a single milled powder while ignoring mixing phenomena.  A methodology is developed that allows experimentally measured sieve-fractions  to be converted into volumetric cluster size distributions. Model parameters describing the rate of aggregation and fragmentation are obtained by fitting the model's predicted average particle size data over time to that measured in experiments.  Different size-dependent aggregation and fragmentation rates are tested in many milling scenarios and the most realistic size-dependence of rates is found.

In the second part of the thesis, the best size-dependent rates are generalised and used with a two-component version of \Smol's system of equations.  This model also includes binary mixing phenomena by considering clusters that have two types of component.  The two-component models are applied to experimental situations using the methods developed for one-component models.  Comparing these multi-component models to experimental measurements verifies
the modelling method and gives reasonable agreement.  An improved fragmentation rate is suggested to enhance the model's accuracy in the prediction of mixing rates.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>The characterisation and recycling of incinerated tyres</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Rice, George Edward</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>TD Environmental technology. Sanitary engineering</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>In excess of 1,000 million tyres are manufactured worldwide every year. The average tyre lasts for approximately 50,000 kilometres before it must be replaced. Each year in the UK approximately 37 million tyres reach the end of their useful life. The used tyre, which is almost identical to the replacement, then requires disposal. As the volume of road traffic increases alternative disposal routes are required to take up the resulting shortfall in capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
SITA Tyre Recycling operate an incinerator in the West Midlands which solely burns scrap tyres. The plant receives a significant proportion of UK scrap tyre waste stream as well as reject tyres from manufacturers. The main waste stream generated is disposed to landfill. The objective of this research was to determine if the waste had potential for recycling which would reduce the burden on landfill and possibly generate revenue through the sale of products.&#xD;
&#xD;
By developing methods to sample and characterise the waste stream it was found to consist of multiple phases that could be individually treated to generate valuable products. Products based on carbon and steel were derived from the combusted rubber and bead wire respectively. Detailed examination of the carbon phase using a range of techniques revealed that many compounds used in the manufacture of the tyre rubber were highly dispersed in a carbon dominated matrix. The success of physical separation processes was limited by the difficulties associated with liberation of the valuable carbon from contaminating elements. The post-combustion steel was found to have an unacceptable sulphur concentration, which was mainly associated with surface coatings of the carbon phase. Through the application of traditional attrition scrubbing the surface coatings were removed and a reduced sulphur content steel product generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pilot scale trials were used to generate large samples for industrial assessment and process optimisation purposes.&#xD;

        <dc:title>Case-based reasoning for course timetabling problems</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Qu, Rong</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>Q Science (General)</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The research in this thesis investigates Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), a Knowledge-Based Reasoning technique that proved to be capable of providing good solutions in educational course timetabling problems. Following the basic idea behind CBR, experiences in solving previous similar timetabling problems are employed to find the solutions for new problems.

A basic CBR system that is hierarchically organized with structured knowledge representations by attribute graphs is proposed in Chapter Four. The system is then further improved to solve a wider range of problems, which is described in Chapter Five. Evaluations on a large number of experiments indicate that this approach could provide a significant step forward in timetabling and scheduling research.
This basic system works well on relatively small problems. To deal with this drawback a multiple-retrieval approach that partitions large timetabling problems into small solvable sub-problems is presented in Chapter Six. Good results are obtained from a wide range of experiments.

In Chapter Seven, a new idea is introduced in CBR for solving timetabling problems by investigating the approach to select the most appropriate heuristic method rather than to employ it directly on the problem, in the attempt to raise the level of generality at which we can operate. All the evidence obtained from the first stage experiments indicates that there is a range of promising future directions.

Finally in Chapter Eight the results of the work are evaluated and some directions for future work are present.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Single molecule interactions in biological systems</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Tessmer, Ingrid</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QD450 Physical and theoretical chemistry</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The interactions of biological molecules are traditionally investigated using ensemble techniques. These provide information on the molecular behaviour based on averaged data resulting from collective ensemble properties. While this has enabled the resolution of structure and function of many proteins and other biomolecules, an understanding of how and why the molecules go about structural changes and modulate inter- and intra-molecular interactions is difficult to gain using these approaches. 

More recently, single molecule techniques have evolved. These allow us to follow the behaviour of the individual molecules over time and/or under changing conditions. From such data, subtle molecular changes can be resolved without the need to synchronise the system. Further, variations within a biological system can be detected which would be lost using the ensemble techniques, due to the concomitant averaging procedures. This is exploited to help understand the molecular procedures involved.

In this thesis, the application and comparison of two of the main single molecule techniques, optical tweezers and AFM, are described. With these, a range of systems was investigated; namely drug-DNA, protein-DNA, and cell adhesive interactions. The presented results provide new and complementary information on the different biological systems, demonstrating the diversity of single molecule applications. 

The combination of different experimental approaches was further exploited to gain a more complete picture of the observed processes. </dc:description>

        <dc:subject>TH7700 Illumination. Lighting</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The reduction of fossil fuel consumption and the associated decrease in greenhouse gas emissions are vital to combat global warming and this can be accomplished, in part, by the use of natural light to provide illumination in buildings.  Demand for artificial lighting and the availability of daylight often correspond, so savings can be significant.
To assess the performance of several innovative daylighting devices and to develop improved models for more established technology, quantitative measurement of output was necessary.  This was achieved by the development of simply constructed photometric integrators which were calibrated by the innovative use of daylight as a source of illuminance.  These devices were found to be consistent and accurate in measuring the luminous flux from a number of devices and in a number of locations. 
The novel light rod was assessed as a core daylighting technology and found to transmit light with high efficiency at aspect ratios of up to 40.  It was found to have higher transmittance than the light pipe and with a considerably smaller diameter, could be used in space-restricted applications.  Light rods were bent by infra-red heating and found to lose minimal transmittance.  The light rod emitter was modified to give a variety of types of light distribution, including side emission and the results were visually and quantitatively assessed.  Energy saving capacity was assessed and a model of performance developed for the first time.  
The long-term measurement of light pipe performance and measurement of length and diameter effects led to several improved models of performance for European latitudes.  Several means of improving yield were investigated, including novel cone concentrators, laser cut panels and innovative high-efficiency reflective films.  The concentrators and films were found to give significantly higher output than a standard light pipe, increasing energy savings and associated benefits for the user.

        <dc:title>Strategies for long-term monitoring of tide gauges using GPS</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Teferle, Felix Norman</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>GC Oceanography</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Changes in mean sea (MSL) level recorded relative to tide gauge benchmarks (TGBM) are corrupted by vertical land movements. Accurate estimates of changes in absolute sea level, require these MSL records to be corrected for ground level changes at tide gauge sites. For more than a decade, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has been used to determine positions of TGBMs and to monitor their position changes, i.e. station velocities, over time in the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS). This was initially carried out by episodic GPS campaigns and later on by continuous GPS (CGPS) or a combination of both.

Highly accurate realizations of the ITRS, satellite orbits and models for the mitigation of systematic effects currently enable the determination of station positions using GPS at the centimetre or even millimetre level. It is however argued that accurate long--term estimates of changes in the vertical component at the 1mm/yr level cannot be achieved, making intercomparisons between GPS estimates and other techniques necessary.

Daily processing and analysis of continuous GPS networks requires automated procedures. The modifications and improvements to the existing procedures at the IESSG are described. The newly developed tools include the monitoring and quality control of daily archived GPS observations and of processing results. A special focus is on the coordinate time series analysis and methodologies used to obtain the best possible estimates of vertical station velocities and associated uncertainties.

The coordinate time series of 21 CGPS stations in the UK and France are analysed. Eight of these stations are co-located with tide gauges. The effects of two processing strategies and two realizations of the ITRS on the coordinate time series are investigated. Filtered coordinate time series are obtained by application of a regional filtering technique. Station velocity estimates are obtained by fitting a model including a linear and annual term, and offsets to the unfiltered and filtered coordinate time series. Realistic uncertainties for these velocities are obtained from the application of two empirical methods which account for coloured noise in the coordinate time series. Results from these are compared to the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), which allows for more rigorous and accurate, simultaneous estimation of the model parameters and their uncertainties. Strategies for coordinate time series analysis on a daily or monthly, and annual or bi-annual basis are defined.

At two CGPS stations the dual-CGPS station concept is tested and compared to the single baseline analysis and the application of an adaptive filter. An empirical method to obtain coordinate time series specific filter parameters is described. This investigation shows that reliable relative vertical station velocity estimates can be obtained after much shorter observation spans than absolute vertical station velocity estimates. The availability of dual-CGPS station pairs allows a simplified processing strategy and a multitude of coordinate time series analysis methods, all contributing to a better understanding of the variations in the positions of CGPS stations.

Vertical station velocity estimates for the unfiltered and filtered coordinate time series and different analysis strategies are compared for 17 of the CGPS stations and show disagreements of up to 2mm/yr. At the eight CGPS stations co-located with or close to tide gauges alternative estimates of vertical land/crustal movements from absolute gravimetry, geological information and glacial isostatic adjustment models are compared to the GPS estimates, and it is suggested that the latter are systematically offset. An alignment procedure is demonstrated, correcting the vertical station velocity estimates of all 17 CGPS stations for this offset. The correlation of the geology-aligned vertical station velocity estimates and the MSL records from eight tide gauges suggests changes in absolute sea level of approximately +1mm/yr around the UK.

        <dc:title>Mechanisms of retention on porous graphitic carbon: Chromatographic and computational chemistry studies</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Simpson, David A</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QD241 Organic chemistry</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Porous graphitic carbon has been developed as a high-performance liquid chromatography stationary phase over the past 30 years. The evolution of PGC as a stationary phase was motivated by the desire to find a substitute for reversed-phase silica gel based materials in areas where these materials are inadequate (e.g. extremes of pH). However, PGC possesses a number of chromatographic properties which are thus far largely unexplained and differ from traditional silica-based reversed-phase supports. 
The retention mechanisms of mono-substituted benzenes and biphenyls on porous graphitic carbon stationary phase were investigated using chromatographic and computational methods. 

The studies on a range of n-alkylbenzene analytes demonstrated that retention on PGC was found to be greatly influenced by hydrophobic parameters such as Hansch-Fujita and log P and that PGC has superior selectivity for isomers of amylbenzene in terms of its chromatographic retention properties when compared to octadecyl-silica (ODS). Molecular modelling of the alkylbenzene analytes indicated that the interaction between toluene and ethylbenzene and PGC was in a cofacial geometry whereas that between the longer chain alkylbenzene was of a face-edge (perpendicular) nature. This was confirmed by the relatively poor retention of highly branched amylbenzenes. 

Benzene derivatives demonstrated retention properties on PGC such that the logarithm of the retention factor (log kw) was found to be closely correlated with a combination of the Hansch-Fujita parameter and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital Energy (ELUMO) of the analytes. This was augmented by similar correlations between log kw and Hansch-Fujita, ELUMO and mean polarisability. Chromatographic studies of the benzene derivatives on PGC gave enhanced retention for polar and charged analytes and reduced retention for the alkyl substituted benzenes used in this study when compared with ODS. Preliminary semi-empirical calculations of the interaction between the analyte and the PGC stationary phase for benzene derivatives showed qualitative relationships between the energy of interaction and log kw for closely related benzene derivatives. 

The retention of mono-substituted biphenyl compounds was found to be greater on PGC than on ODS stationary phase, with the strongest retention found for highly conjugated species (such as 4-phenylcinnamic acid and 4-vinylbiphenyl). This observation supports the hypothesis that the presence of a planar moiety in a molecule imparts an increased retention when using PGC as the stationary phase. PGC was found to be more retentive for the separation of both polar and non-polar biphenyl derivatives. Semi-empirical calculations suggested that the ease with which an analyte could attain a planar geometry was an important factor influencing the retention of biphenyl derivatives on PGC.

        <dc:title>The Enantioselective Generation of Bridgehead Enolates</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Kirk, Douglas Thomas</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QD241 Organic chemistry</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Chapter One gives an introduction to the key concepts of bridgehead alkene formation and its relevance to the formation of bridgehead enolates of ketones including a review of bridgehead enolates in synthesis. The review is limited to the generation of bridgehead carbanions alpha to a carbonyl group and does not cover bridgehead cations, radicals or any anions except those already mentioned. In addition, a brief introduction to chiral base methodology and a review of the latest developments is included.
Chapter Two describes the generation of bridgehead enolates in various bridged bicyclic ketones using chiral and achiral lithium amide bases and their subsequent interception with chlorotrimethylsilane. The chiral bridgehead silanes resulting from enantioselective deprotonation were shown to undergo silyl exchange reactions with TBAT as fluoride source in the presence of various electrophiles.
Chapter Three describes a review of bridgehead enolates of imides and describes the extension of the developed methodology in Chapter Two to the generation and trapping of bridgehead enolates in bridged bicyclic imides and lactams. In addition bridgehead enolates are shown to react in the presence of non-classical in situ electrophiles such as methyl iodide, allyl bromide, benzyl bromide, prenyl bromide and pivaloyl chloride in high yield and enantioselectivity. The secondary bridgehead deprotonation of monosubstituted imides was also achieved resulting in double bridgehead functionalised products with high ee. The bridgehead silanes are shown to undergo silyl exchange reactions and display silyl directed regioselective reduction and thionation reactions. The mechanism of deprotonation, comparison to known examples and the origin of bridgehead carbanion stability are discussed.
Chapter Four contains the experimental procedures and analytical data for the preparation of the novel compounds described herein followed by the appendix of selected NMR and X-ray data.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Gravitational redshifts and the mass distributions of galaxies and clusters</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Coggins, Simon John</dc:creator>

        <dc:description>This thesis studies a new method of constraining the mass distributions of elliptical galaxies and clusters of galaxies: gravitational redshift. The aim was to determine the types of astrophysical object in which gravitational redshift can be most readily detected and to attempt to observe the effect for the first time in a single object.

Longslit stellar kinematics were combined with planetary nebulae kinematics to study the mass distribution of M87. Jeans modelling showed that, although the best-fit model gave too little mass (Upsilon = 5.34+/-0.34, beta = 0.71+/-0.03, M_halo = 2.64+/-0.92 x 10^12 M_sun), by adjusting the orbital anisotropy it was possible to construct a model that was consistent with both the kinematics and existing X-ray gas measurements.

Longslit kinematics from the literature were used to attempt to determine the mass-to-light ratio of a sample of elliptical galaxies using gravitational redshift. Models were developed to calculate the expected gravitational redshift from the surface brightness profile. The best-fit mass-to-light ratios were found using this model and also obtained independently using the Jeans equation. The results were not statistically inconsistent with the expected H-band mass-to-light ratios predicted by stellar population models - the Jeans modelling gave a mean mass-to-light ratio of Upsilon_sigma = 1.67+/-0.10, while the gravitational redshift predicted Upsilon_v = 4.84+/-2.67.

Integral field spectroscopy of the centre of M60 was undertaken in an attempt to detect gravitational redshift in the centre of an individual galaxy for the first time. The velocity field was summed around the galaxy's isophotes to remove the effect of rotation. Models were constructed to predict the gravitational redshift, which were then compared to the data. It was found that the shallow slope of the light profile made it impossible to detect a gravitational redshift in this case, but that the scatter of the data points suggests that a signal of a few km/s could be detected. Consideration of the models led to a better understanding of the most suitable targets for this kind of study.

An analysis of the 2dF groups catalogue was made in order to attempt to determine the strength of the gravitational redshift in clusters of galaxies. A new method was developed for measuring the signal in clusters. As part of the analysis, the density distribution of the clusters was obtained. It was found that they followed an exponential profile, which scaled linearly with the size of the cluster. The gravitational redshift was used to attempt to constrain the mean cluster mass, but it was found that the errors were too large to rule out all but the largest masses with any certainty. Future studies would require either a much larger sample, or one which concentrates specifically on the most uniform, high mass clusters.

Gravitational redshift offers a new approach to studying the mass distributions of galaxies and clusters that requires many fewer assumptions regarding the underlying physics than many of the current methods. Unfortunately, it also suffers from a number of potential setbacks. Recent advances in instrument technology, combined with the careful selection of suitable targets should allow gravitational redshift to become a viable tool for studying the nature and distribution of dark matter.

        <dc:title>The use of computer graphics and virtual reality for visual impact assessments
</dc:title>

        <dc:description>Changes to the visual character of the landscape can become a key issue capable of influencing the outcome of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). These changes are commonly referred to as visual impact, and it is recognised, unlike many other aspects of EIAs, that Visual Impact Assessment (VIA) relies less upon measurement than upon experience and judgement (IEATLI, 1995). Currently, there are very few quantitative techniques for the evaluation of visibility and it is mostly assessed qualitatively since it is concerned with the human appreciation of the landscape (Zewe and Koglin, 1995 and Wherrett, 2002). The main problem with qualitative techniques in assessing visual impact is that they may lead to bias due to their inherent subjectivity, hence there is a need for a more structured and consistent approach towards VIA.

To reduce the subjectivity currently associated with VIAs, new quantitative techniques have been developed and existing spatial and qualitative techniques have been improved upon. The techniques developed in this research use Computer Graphics (CG) technology, including the field of Virtual Reality (VR). 

A quantitative method to calculate percentage view change has been developed that allows the accurate determination of the variation in any view, caused by an existing or proposed development. The method uses three dimensional (3D) CG models of an environment and software that has been developed using a scripting language from a 3D modelling software package. A new method has also been developed to create Fields of Visual Influence (FVIs) using standard 3D modelling techniques. The method improves upon the accuracy and efficiency of existing FVI techniques. A novel VR simulation technique has also been developed that attempts to reduce the subjectivity associated with simulations, by integrating quantitative and spatial techniques.

        <dc:title>Improving Chemical Plant Safety Training Using Virtual Reality</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Nasios, Konstantinos</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>TP Chemical technology</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The chemical engineering industry often requires people to work in hazardous environments and to operate complicated equipment which often limits the type of training that be carried out on site. The daily job of chemical plant operators is becoming more demanding due to the increasing plant complexity together with increasing requirements on plant safety, production capacity, product quality and cost effectiveness. The importance of designing systems and environments that are as safe as possible to educate and train personnel is vital for the chemical process industries. Virtual reality offers the potential to expose personnel to hazardous situations in a safe, highly visual and interactive manner.

Virtual reality has been proposed as a technological breakthrough that holds the power to facilitate learning. The ability to visualise complex and dynamic systems involving personnel, equipment and layouts during any real operation is a potential advantage of such an approach. Virtual reality and multimedia training is commonly used in many industries, aiding understanding and memory retention and creating a more interactive learning experience.

Four desktop virtual reality training environments were developed for this research which highlighted issues related to chemical process dynamic simulation and plant safety. The pump training system is a virtual reality environment, which was built using the SAFE-VR virtual engine, to train personnel to operate two centrifugal pumps. The virtual hazard spotting exercise focuses on improving the users' safety awareness of electrical and occupational hygiene hazards. The virtual boiler plant is a complicated and high detailed virtual training environment, which is characterised by its flexibility and by a real time dynamic simulation of the steam generation chemical process. The virtual flooding and gas absorption experiment was based on an undergraduate laboratory experiment for the Chemical Engineering degree course at the University of Nottingham, focusing primarily on training and safety issues of students using the equipment. The dynamic features of the virtual absorption column simulation give high level of realism in the virtual environment.

        <dc:title>Some studies of fluid mixing and transport</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Finn, Matthew David</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QA801 Analytic mechanics</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>In this thesis we study four problems with potential biological and industrial applications which rely on fluid mixing and transport.

The problem of simultaneous ultrafiltration, diffusion and osmosis across a membrane separating two fluids is studied, numerically and asymptotically, as a model for an artificial kidney dialyser. Couplings between the different transport mechanisms prove significant in determining overall transport rates. Our model appears to be the first to treat the three transport mechanisms in a spatially structured framework, and shows that previous, spatially averaged models can overestimate transport rates.  Our results can be used to optimise dialyser geometry and to profile dialysis sessions. 

The remainder of this thesis concerns some fundamentals of fluid mixing and mixer design. Techniques for assessing the quality of fluid mixing are reviewed, and applied to a two-dimensional laminar chaotic flow. We find no outright optimum mixing method across the range of measures, suggesting that `sieving' a collection of mixing methods according to increasingly complicated mixing measures may fail to identify a global optimum.

`Topological chaos' appears to allow good mixing stretch rate to be built-in to batch mixer design, avoiding the need to tune the mixer parameters, provided a correct flow topology is created. We show that the theoretical stretch rate predictions are achieved quite tightly, in practice in a significant fraction of the flow domain; we investigate the practicalities of topologically chaotic mixers.

Finally, we discuss whether topological chaos may also apply to three-dimensional static mixer design, in a braided pipe mixer, in which pipe flow is mixed around carefully designed twisted inner pipes. We expect such a device to mix well if the inner pipes have appropriate topology. However, we demonstrate how three-dimensional flow features can undermine mixing performance.</dc:description>

        <dc:subject>QC170 Atomic physics. Constitution and properties of matter</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The spin-dynamics of Fermi-liquid helium-3 in pure form and in its
mixtures with helium-4 are considered in this thesis. A linearised
model of the spin dynamics is developed from Leggett's equation of
motion, including spin-diffusion, the Leggett-Rice spin-rotation
effect and cylindrical boundary conditions . The equations are
solved using a matrix formalism, allowing simulation of FIDs, NMR
spectra and spin-echoes. The boundary conditions are shown to
cause deviations of spin-echo amplitude and phase from the
predictions of Leggett and Rice, for realistic experiments. The
model is extended to include the demagnetising field (dipolar
field) due to the magnetisation of the sample itself. Simulations
show that, when the demagnetising field is strong, spectral
clustering is present and sharp peaks are observed in the NMR
spectrum.

Data from NMR experiments on 3He and 3He-4He mixtures in
an 11.3T magnetic field, performed in Nottingham in 1999/2000, are
analysed. The analysis of 6.2% 3He mixture is predominantly by
least-squares fitting of the model (excluding demagnetising field)
to spin-echo data, yielding the transverse spin-diffusion
coefficient and spin-rotation parameter as functions of
temperature down to 3.4mK. Parameters are seen to deviate from the
1/Ta^2 characteristic of Fermi-liquid transport parameters, with
a 1/(T^2+Ta^2) form, indicative of spin-transport anisotropy.
The anisotropy temperature scale Ta is found to be 6+-1 mK.
Analysis of pure 3He experiments is by qualitative comparison
of spectroscopic data with the model (including demagnetising
field): many observed features are reproduced by the simulation.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>In Chapter 1 we introduce many of the concepts and techniques, including Nevanlinna theory, referred to throughout the rest of the thesis.  In Chapter 2 we extend a result of Langley and Shea concerning the distribution of zeros of the logarithmic derivative of meromorphic functions to higher order logarithmic derivatives.  Chapter 3 details an alternative formulation, avoiding reference to the multiplicity of poles, of a result due to Chuang concerning differential polynomials.  In Chapter 4 we generalise a theorem of Bergweiler and Eremenko concerning transcendental singularities of the the inverse of a meromorphic function.  In Chapter 5 we generalise a result of Gordon to show that an unbounded analytic function on a quasidisk has a strong form of unboundedness there.  Chapter 6 contains a proof of a result concerning the normality of families of analytic functions such that the composition of any of these functions with a fixed (meromorphic) outer factor has no fixpoints in a given domain.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>The Use Of Computer Graphics And Visualisation (From Reconstruction To Training) For The Resource Sector Of Western Australia</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Fowle, Kenneth</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>TD Environmental technology. Sanitary engineering</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The minerals and energy sector can rightly be classified as comprising an extremely hazardous working environment in which numerous situations exist for accidents and incidents involving personnel and equipment to occur.

Accidents are often explained by what are referred to as 'human factor'. The often used explanation, 'technical-failure', gives the impression that technology lives a life of its own without human intervention. However, technical failure often occurs because of human errors in construction, installation, maintenance or operation. It is the person who triggers the risks who is made morally (and sometime legally) responsible. When an operator makes a mistake (an active error)  he or she is personally blamed. When a designer or constructor makes a mistake, or when cheap or inferior equipment is bought, or when maintenance is faulty, the responsibility is depersonalised and it becomes a 'technology' fault (Sunderstrom-Frisk, 1998).

This research examines ways of using expert information using computer graphics and visualisation to produce visual applications that demonstrate and explain, but also have the added ability to teach the user or viewer, with the intent to assess their competency.
Today's technology provides educators, students, professional bodies and the general public access to large amounts of information in a visual form. We repackage technical literature and data as movies and videos for audiences to view, instead of reading the information. Understanding may be achieved rapidly instead of taking days, weeks or months. From a visual presentation the viewers absorb information, which is easy to retain. 

The reconstructions discussed in this research concern the minerals and energy sector of Western Australia. They not only show what went wrong but can also be customised to demonstrate how to prevent an accident/incident. The benefits of this to industry is primarily: the ability to reuse the reconstruction instead of closing down a production line that cost the company and industry many thousands of dollars, and no lives are exposed to hazardous environments while examining the reconstruction for investigation or training purposes.

        <dc:title>Application of a three-surface kinematic hardening model to the repeated loading of thinly surfaced pavements</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Hau, Kah Wai</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>TE Highway engineering. Roads and pavements</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Little effort has been made to apply the Critical State Soil Mechanics concept to the prediction of pavement response. The aim of this research is to apply soil mechanics principles, particularly the kinematic hardening concept, to the prediction of the response of lightly trafficked pavements to repeated loading. For this purpose, the finite element critical state program CRISP is used.

A comparison is made between the predictions given by the three-surface kinematic hardening (3-SKH) model and a layered elastic analysis BISAR for the resilient deformation produced by repeated loading of a thinly surfaced pavement, and the models are found to be in good agreement. The ability of the 3-SKH model to predict soil behaviour under cyclic loading, and under one-dimensional loading, unloading and reloading is also evaluated. A comparison between model predictions and experimental data obtained by other researchers shows that the 3-SKH model over-predicts the value of K0,nc and hence shear strain during monotonic loading. This problem is magnified when the model is applied to cyclic loading behaviour where large numbers of cycles are involved. The model also predicts an accumulation of negative shear strain with increasing number of cycles under some stress conditions. This will lead to unrealistic predictions of rutting in pavements. However, the model is suitable for obtaining resilient parameters for input to a layered elastic analysis program.

A new model, which is a modified version of the 3-SKH model, is therefore proposed by modifying the flow rule and the hardening moduli. This model can correctly predict the value of K0,nc and reduce the amount of shear strain predicted. The model also eliminates the problem of accumulation of negative shear strain with increasing number of cycles. The new model introduces two additional parameters, one of which can be determined by one-dimensional normal compression test, and the other by fitting a set of cyclic loading data. The new model is used to design the required thickness of granular material using the permissible resilient subgrade strain and permanent rut depth criteria during construction. It is found that the new model predicts a realistic granular layer thickness required to prevent excessive rutting, thus showing much promise for use in design of thinly surfaced pavements.

        <dc:title>The nanoscale characterization and interparticulate interactions of pharmaceutical materials</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Hooton, Jennifer Claire</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>RS Pharmacy and materia medica</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The aim of this project is to compare pharmaceutical particles made using a Nektar supercritical fluid technology technique called solution enhanced dispersion by supercritical fluids (SEDSTM) to those made using more traditional techniques.  This involves a comparison of not only the surface properties of both types of particles, but also the interparticulate interactions.  The majority of the work has involved the use of the atomic force microscope (AFM) as both a tool for imaging and for the acquisition of localized force measurements.

The first experimental chapter of this work describes a method developed in order to image the contacting asperities of a particle.  The AFM has the potential to provide useful information regarding single particle interactions to complement data generated from bulk techniques.  In this chapter, the AFM artefact of tip imaging was used to produce 3D images of the asperities of particles of micronised and SEDSTM salbutamol sulphate, an anti-asthma drug, contacting a model surface of highly orientated pyrolytic graphite (HOPG).  These data were recorded in a model propellant environment, used in order to simulate the environment that would be found in pressurised metered dose inhalers, such as those used by asthmatics.  From the images generated the contacting area was estimated to be 1.1x10-3 mm2 for the micronised material, and 1.4x10-3 for the SEDSTM material.  The work of adhesion for both of the materials was also calculated, and the values of 19.0 mJm-2 and 4.0 mJm-2 were obtained for the micronised and SEDSTM samples respectively.  This supported available data that indicated the SEDS material had a lower surface energy than the micronised drug, and that it is possible to make comparisons between different modified AFM probes.

The second chapter develops this work so that it can be applied to an air environment, which is applicable to more pharmaceutical systems.  Here, force measurements were again performed using AFM, with the same drug samples studied in the first chapter, except a controlled relative humidity (RH) environment was used, so that the variation in adhesion with increasing RH could be studied.  Two types of measurement were undertaken.  The first involved the use of blank AFM tips on compressed disks of drug material, and the second involved the use of drug particles mounted onto AFM tips on both HOPG and compressed disks of drug.  With the blank AFM tip and particle modified AFM tip on HOPG work it was observed that the SEDSTM materials showed a peak in adhesion force at 22% RH while the micronised salbutamol showed a peak at 44% RH.  From this, a three-scenario model of linking morphology of contact to adhesion was developed to explain the observed peaks in adhesion.  In addition, the surface energies of each of the two samples were calculated using the force measurements acquired against HOPG and compressed disks of material and compared.  The micronised material was found to have a higher surface energy than the SEDSTM material (10.8 mJm-2 cf 5 mJm-2) when data acquired against HOPG was used.  However, when data acquired using the compressed disks of drug were used, the SEDSTM had a higher surface energy than the micronised (29.9 mJm-2 cf 22.6 mJm-2).  This higher value was attributed to different surface roughness effects found with the compressed disks.  

The third chapter uses the techniques and models developed in the previous chapters to examine the effect of polymorphism on surface energy, structure and particulate interactions.  Three polymorphs of the drug sulphathiazole (forms I, II and IV) were formed using the SEDSTM technique, one of which (form I) was formed using two different solvents: methanol and acetone.  Force measurements were performed using the AFM at controlled humidity using particles of each of the polymorphs mounted onto AFM tips against substrates of HOPG and the polymorph under analysis.  This data was then related to the model developed in the previous chapter, and calculations were undertaken to assess the different surface energies of each of the four samples.  For some of the samples it was observed that peaks were again occurring in the data, at 22% RH for polymorphs I-methanol and III, and 44% for polymorph IV.  No peak was seen for polymorph I-acetone.  These peaks were then related to the surface energy calculated for each of the polymorphs, as polymorphs I-methanol and III were found to have lower surface energy (0.99 mJm-2 and 1.17 mJm-2 respectively) than polymorphs IV and I-acetone (20.33 mJm-2 and 309 mJm-2).

The fourth chapter examines the application of AFM to an industrial problem.  When using the SEDSTM process to manufacture insulin, it was observed that the SEDSTM material had poorer flow properties than that of the unprocessed material.  Using the AFM as both an imaging and force measurement tool, this chapter explores the application of imaging and the adhesion models and surface energy calculations previously developed to understand this problem.   The AFM images showed the presence of highly aggregated particles of SEDSTM insulin, compared to the unprocessed insulin that appeared to be more crystalline.  When force measurements were performed against both HOPG and particles of the material under analysis, non of the unprocessed, and only one of the SEDSTM particle tips prepared displayed the peak behaviour seen with previous measurements, and instead displayed a continual increase in adhesion force with humidity.  In addition, when the surface energy was calculated, the SEDSTM material was found to be higher than the unprocessed insulin (77.5 mJm-2 cf 2.4 mJm-2).  The increase in adhesion force was related to the particles agglomerating together, due to the presence of a higher surface energy and high amorphous content of the particles.

The final experimental chapter uses techniques that compliment AFM analysis to examine another industrial problem.  The SEDSTM process can be used to co-formulate drugs with other materials such as polymers.  In this chapter, the drug pregabalin has been co-formulated with lipid in order to produce a coating around the drug to mask taste.  The use of AFM as an imaging tool, and the additional techniques of X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) have been used to generate an understanding of surface structure and chemistry of this heterogeneous system.  The AFM images showed no areas of surface heterogeneous behaviour, although the largest scan size was only 5 mm x 5 mm.  However both the XPS and ToF-SIMS spectra, which samples far larger areas (up to 75 mm x 75 mm) showed the presence of lipid and drug molecules.  It was concluded that the lipid was not forming a uniform layer around the drug molecule, but was instead forming large patches that were beyond the resolution of the AFM.

This work aims therefore to provide a fundamental study of the application of AFM to real pharmaceutical systems.  In particular models are developed which allow not only ranking of particle interactions but the quantification of factors such as surface energy and work of adhesion.  Finally the significance of the morphology of the inter-particulate contact has been explored at the nanoscale.

        <dc:title>Development and application of hyperheuristics to personnel scheduling</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Soubeiga, Eric</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>T Technology (General)</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>This thesis is concerned with the investigation of hyperheuristic techniques. Hyperheuristics are heuristics which choose heuristics in order to solve  a given optimisation problem. In this thesis we investigate and develop a number of hyperheuristic techniques including a hyperheuristic which uses a choice function in order to select which low-level heuristic to apply at each decision point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our hyperheuristics by means of three personnel scheduling problems taken from the real world. For each application problem, we apply our hyperheuristics to several instances and compare our results with those of other heuristic methods. For all problems, the choice function hyperheuristic appears to be superior to other hyperheuristics considered. It also produces results competitive with those obtained using other sophisticated means. It is hoped that 
 
- hyperheuristics can produce solutions of good quality, often competitive with those of modern heuristic techniques, within a short amount of implementation and development time, using only simple and easy-to-implement low-level heuristics. 

- hyperheuristics are easily re-usable methods as opposed to some metaheuristic methods which tend to use extensive problem-specific information in order to arrive at good solutions. 


These two latter points constitute the main contributions of this thesis. </dc:description>

        <dc:subject>QD241 Organic chemistry</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The main focus of this thesis is the investigation of structure and motion of different materials by applying different solid-state NMR techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the first section (1) some of the bases of NMR are described both in a Classical (1.1) and Quantum Mechanical (1.2) approach, while the next two sections deal with the experimental part of the work.&#xD;
&#xD;
In section 2 solid-state NMR studies of CsC60 are described and an unambiguous assignment of the 13C NMR spectrum of the polymer phase of CsC60, which is based solely on our experimental data, is presented. In contrast to previous work, the assignment does not rely on the knowledge of the electronic structure of this material and our results support a fully three-dimensional electronic structure as opposed to a quasi one-dimensional one. This is achieved using a two-dimensional 13C MAS NMR correlation experiment, which identifies nuclei coupled via a through-bond scalar interaction, the Refocused INADEQUATE. &#xD;
&#xD;
In section 3 solid-state NMR experiments performed on polyethylene and long-chain n-alkanes corresponding to the formula C246H494 are described. Particular attention is given to some specific issues such as chain folding and a detailed study of the saturation-recovery curves (T1) obtained is carried out for different materials. The model elaborated is able to simulate all the data recorded and the presence of an interphase between the crystalline and the amorphous parts of the samples is proposed. &#xD;
To help the understanding of the structure and the motion of long-chain n-alkanes in section 3 some deuterated samples such as C216H434-d24 and C12H25(CH2)192CHDC11D23+C162H326 ("the mixture") are also studied. Deuterium NMR is widely used and we fit all the experimental line shape of the different samples at different temperatures. Diverse models for the structure and motion of such materials are given, which take into account all the experimental results obtained. &#xD;

        <dc:title>Saturation of Mordell-Weil Groups of Elliptic Curves over Number Fields</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Prickett, Martin</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QA440 Geometry</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Given a subgroup B of a finitely-generated abelian group A, the saturation B of B is defined to be the largest subgroup of A containing B with finite index.

In this thesis we consider a crucial step in the determination of the Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic curve, E(K). Methods such as Descent may produce subgroups H of E(K) with [H:H]&gt;1. We have determined an algorithm for calculating H given H, and hence for completing the process of finding the Mordell-Weil group. Our method has been implemented in MAGMA with two versions of the programs; one for general number fields K and the other for Q. It builds upon previous work by S. Siksek.

Our problem splits into two. First we can use geometry of numbers arguments to establish an upper bound N for the index [H:H]. Second for each remaining prime p&lt;N we seek to prove either that H is p-saturated, i.e. p|[H:H], or to enlarge H by index p. 

To solve the first problem,
1. We have devised and implemented an algorithm that searches for points on E(K) up to a specified naive height bound.
2. We have devised and implemented an algorithm that calculates the subgroup Egr(K) of points with good reduction at specified valuations.
3. We have implemented joint work with S. Siksek and J. Cremona to calculate an upper bound on the difference of the canonical and naive height of points on an elliptic curve.
4. We have helped to devise and have implemented joint work with S. Siksek and J. Cremona to calculate a lower bound on the canonical heights of non-torsion points on E(K) with K a totally real field.

To solve the second problem,
1. As in earlier work by Siksek, we use homomorphisms to prove p-saturation for primes p. We however use the Tate-Lichtenbaum pairing, and we show that, using this pairing, our  method will always prove H is p-saturated if that is the case.
2. We show that Siksek's original method will fail for some curves.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>The Regulation of Peptide Mimotope/Epitope Recognition by Monoclonal Antibodies</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Smith, Richard Gary</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>RS Pharmacy and materia medica</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Protein-based therapeutics play an increasingly important role in medicine, and the exquisite bio-recognition properties exhibited by antibodies has also led the their use in a number of other fields apart from medicine.  The increasing use of these molecules requires more efficient methods of purification.  A review of the current purification strategies was conducted.  Of all the purification methods studied, peptide epitope/mimotope affinity chromatography proved to be the method of choice - resulting in antibodies exhibiting high specific immunoreactivity. The need to tailor unique affinity ligands for each antibody to be purified by peptide epitope/ mimotope affinity chromatography was identified as the major problem with this technique.  A review of the technologies available to regulate the antibody-antigen interaction was conducted.  Little was published on the use of phage display for the discovery of peptide ligands for use in peptide mimotope affinity chromatography.  

Experiments were conducted using a polyvalent phage display library to identify novel peptide ligands for the purification of the therapeutic monoclonal antibody C595.  A novel peptide was isolated which demonstrated improved chromatographic performance compared to the standard epitope peptide used to purify mAb C595 from biological supernatants.  Circular dichroism showed that the novel peptide had a more highly ordered structure at 4oC and room temperature than the epitope peptide, and fluorescence quenching revealed a higher equilibrium association constant.

A method for the optimisation of peptide mimotopes derived from phage display, cross-reactive with an anti-steroid antibody was investigated.  Improvements relating to the selection of lead peptide sequences are described, and the use of mimotopes in an assay to determine concentrations of steroid in solution has been demonstrated.  The optimised mimotope was used as an effective paratope-specific affinity ligand.

A novel method for selecting high affinity antibody fragments in vivo is described. The C595 scFv gene was fused to a gene encoding  green fluorescent protein and incorporated into the phagemid vector pCANTAB 5E.  The fusion protein could not be expressed at high levels and could only be detected using epitope affinity chromatography in combination with ELISA.

        <dc:title>Morphological and process dynamics of the Lower Mississippi River</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Harmar, Oliver Philip</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>GB Physical geography</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>This thesis uses data sets at a range of spatial and temporal scales to examine the geomorphological response of the Lower Mississippi River to engineering and management.  During the twentieth century the geomorphology of the Lower Mississippi River has been transformed by a series of engineering modifications to improve flood control and aid navigation.  These have included steepening of the longitudinal profile by removal of the most sinuous bends, fixing the river to a constant planform through extensive bank stabilisation, and regulating sediment movement through the channel system by dike field construction.  Prior to these modifications, the Lower Mississippi River adjusted its planform morphology to satisfy large-scale flow resistance requirements.  However, this mode of adjustment has been effectively removed and adjustments are now restricted to the long profile and cross-sectional form.  Morphological analysis reveals that the river has responded to engineering intervention at two principal scales: by vertical changes in the elevation of the channel bed at the reach-scale; and by increasing large-scale bedform resistance at the sub-reach scale through longitudinal and cross-sectional adjustments.  These mutual changes are consistent with the changes in water surface elevation in the post-modification period noted by Biedenharn and Watson (1997).  However, analysis of morphological and process dynamics at shorter timescales shows that geomorphological response remains difficult to explain.  This is because geomorphological behaviour at any scale, and in any location within an alluvial channel, is a product of complex spatially-distributed feedbacks between operating processes and multiple scales of channel morphology.  This has general significance in terms of research design because detecting the complexity at each scale of adjustment, and forming linkages between scales of adjustment, is dependent on taking into account all possible degrees of freedom, and applying a range of complementary analytical techniques.

        <dc:title>An Analysis of Diversity in Genetic Programming</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Gustafson, Steven Matt</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QA 75 Electronic computers. Computer science</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Genetic programming is a metaheuristic search method that uses a population of variable-length computer programs and a search strategy based on biological evolution. The idea of automatic programming has long been a goal of artificial intelligence, and genetic programming presents an intuitive method for automatically evolving programs. However, this method is not without some potential drawbacks. Search using procedural representations can be complex and inefficient. In addition, variable sized solutions can become unnecessarily large and difficult to interpret. 

The goal of this thesis is to understand the dynamics of genetic programming that encourages efficient and effective search. Toward this goal, the research focuses on an important property of genetic programming search: the population. The population is related to many key aspects of the genetic programming algorithm. In this programme of research, diversity is used to describe and analyse populations and their effect on search. A series of empirical investigations are carried out to better understand the genetic programming algorithm. 

The research begins by studying the relationship between diversity and search. The effect of increased population diversity and a metaphor of search are then examined. This is followed by an investigation into the phenomenon of increased solution size and problem difficulty. The research concludes by examining the role of diverse individuals, particularly the ability of diverse individuals to affect the search process and ways of improving the genetic programming algorithm. 

This thesis makes the following contributions: (1) An analysis shows the complexity of the issues of diversity and the relationship between diversity and fitness, (2) The genetic programming search process is characterised by using the concept of genetic lineages and the sampling of structures and behaviours, (3) A causal model of the varied rates of solution size increase is presented, (4) A new, tunable problem demonstrates the contribution of different population members during search, and (5) An island model is proposed to improve the search by speciating dissimilar individuals into better-suited environments. 

Currently, genetic programming is applied to a wide range of problems under many varied contexts. From artificial intelligence to operations research, the results presented in this thesis will benefit population-based search methods, methods based on the concepts of evolution and search methods using variable-length representations. </dc:description>

        <dc:title>Mechanics of railway ballast behaviour</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Lim, Wee Loon</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>TF Railroad engineering and operation</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>It is important to have consistent ballast testing methods that provide results reflecting the performance of different ballast materials in the railway trackbed.  In this research, extensive laboratory tests were conducted to investigate the correlation between simple ballast index tests, and box tests simulating ballast field loading conditions in a simplified and controlled manner.  In the box test, a sleeper load of 40kN was applied to a simulated sleeper on the top of a sample of ballast in a box of dimensions 700x300x450mm.  The ballast was tamped using a Kango hammer which caused particles to rearrange as the level of the sleeper was raised. 

The ballast tests investigated in this project are those ballast tests specified in the Railtrack Line Specification (RT/CE/S/006 Issue 3, 2000), in addition to single particle crushing tests, oedometer tests, petrographic analysis, and box tests.  It was found that there was some correlation between the single particle crushing tests, oedometer tests, box tests and petrographic analysis.  One of the current ballast tests, namely the Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) test, which is analogous to the oedometer test, is not appropriate because the ACV test uses 10-14mm ballast particles, and there is a size effect on the strength of ballast and different ballasts have different size effects.  However, if an oedometer test is used on track ballast, the results correlate better with ballast field performance as simulated in the box tests. 

Six ballasts were tested: A, B, C, D, E and F (mineralogy of these ballasts can be found in the appendix).  The aim was to examine the relative performance of these ballasts and to establish which index tests were most indicative of performance in the box test.  Simple index tests were performed on each of the ballasts, whilst box tests were only performed on ballasts A, B, C and D.  The box tests were generally performed wet by adding a known volume of water at each tamp.  For ballast A, controlled tests were also performed on dry ballast, and tests involving traffic loading only and tamping only were also conducted.  A box test on 10-14mm ballast A was also conducted to investigate the size effect on ballast behaviour in the box.  The Wet Attrition Value (WAV), Los Angeles Abrasion (LAA), and Micro-Deval Attrition (MDA) seem to be suitable parameters to indicate ballast performance in the box test.  However, this is considered to be due to the rearrangement of particles in the box test caused by the simulated tamping.

In addition to the laboratory tests, the application of discrete element program PFC3D (Itasca Consulting Group, Inc., 1999) in simulating ballast behaviour was also investigated.  Single particle crushing test was simulated to produce crushable agglomerates with a distribution of strengths of ballast A.  These agglomerates were then used to simulate the oedometer test.  The resulting normal compression line was compared with that for real oedometer tests: discrepancies can be attributed to the simplified geometry of the agglomerates.  Due to the high computational time in simulating a box test with crushable agglomerates, uncrushable spherical balls and uncrushable angular agglomerates were used to represent individual ballast particles in the box.  Important aspects of ballast behaviour under repeated loading, namely resilient and permanent deformation, were studied.  It was found that the box test on uncrushable angular agglomerates give less permanent deformation compared with the test on spherical balls, because of the additional resistance provided by the irregular shape of the agglomerates.

        <dc:title>Functional characterisation of ABC-type metal ion uptake systems in the staphylococci</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Ridley, Kristian</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QP501 Animal biochemistry</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Previously, the sitABC operon of S. epidermidis has been shown to be regulated in response to the extracellular concentration of both iron and manganese, though the identity of the true substrate for this putative ABC-type import system remains to be determined.  Through the course of these investigations, the metal binding characteristics of the substrate binding component, SitC, were investigated further.  Recombinant protein was over-expressed and purified as an oligomeric form.  The metal binding properties of purified SitC were studied using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, which demonstrated a primary specificity for Mn2+ ions with additional lower affinities for Fe2+ and Zn2+ ions.  Hill analysis showed metal ion binding proceeded with dissociation constants within the micromolar range and with the strongest degree of cooperativity with Mn2+.  As only a single metal ion binding site is expected to reside within SitC this cooperativity was proposed to occur intermolecularly.  Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) revealed dissociation between metal ions and SitC with Mn2+ almost completely dissociating, and which may be due to conformational changes required to relay the substrate(s) through the transport system.  A molar ratio of bound metal ion to protein approaching 1:1, suggests SitC possesses only a single metal ion binding site.  These data suggest SitABC may function primarily in manganese uptake.  MntC from S. aureus is regarded as an orthologue of SitC, and which has previously been shown by mutational analysis to function solely in manganese accumulation.  An amino-terminal truncate of MntC (His(6)-MntC-N) was over-expressed also in an oligomeric form and the metal binding properties compared to SitC using CD analysis.  Using this method, His(6)-MntC-N demonstrated cooperative primary specificity for Mn2+, with secondary affinity for Zn2+ and Cu2+ but no evidence of Fe2+ binding was apparent.  These data support the previous hypothesis that SitC and MntC are orthologous in their primary metal ion specificity, though attempts to provide confirmatory functional evidence through mutational analysis of sitABC were unsuccessful. </dc:description>

        <dc:title>Analogues of Picard sets for meromorphic functions with a deficient value</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Kendall, Guy</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QA299 Analysis</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Picard's theorem states that a non-constant function which is meromorphic in the complex plane C omits at most two values of the extended complex plane C*. A Picard set for a family of functions F is a subset E of the plane such that every transcendental f in F takes every value of C*, with at most two exceptions, infinitely often in C-E.

If f is transcendental and meromorphic in the plane, then:

(i) [Hayman and others] if N is a positive integer, f^Nf' takes all finite non-zero values infinitely often; 

(ii) [Hayman] either f takes every finite value infinitely often, or each derivative f^(k) takes every finite non-zero value infinitely often.

We can seek analogues of Picard sets ie subsets E of the plane and an associated family of functions F, such that (for case (i)) f^Nf' takes all finite non-zero values infinitely often in C-E, for all f in F. Similarly for case (ii).

In this thesis we improve or extend the results previously known, both for Picard sets proper and for the analogous cases (i) and (ii) mentioned above, when the family of functions F consists of meromorphic functions which have deficient poles (in the sense of Nevanlinna).</dc:description>

        <dc:title>Children left at home alone: the construction of a social problem</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Calcraft, Rebecca</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>HQ The family. Marriage. Woman</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The question of when a child is old enough to be left at home alone, and under what circumstances, is a dilemma faced by many parents and professionals. Adopting a social constructionist perspective of social problems, this thesis explores professional perceptions and policy responses to the issue of children left at home alone since the passing of the Children Act in 1989. The law in England and Wales does not specify an age at which it is deemed safe to leave a child unsupervised at home, a practice sometimes referred to as 'self-care'. Professionals respond to the issue through non-legalistic, more persuasive interventions. The media also plays a role in regulating parenting practices, as demonstrated in the early 1990s, when the British press covered a number of stories involving parents who left their children at 'home alone'. The issue continues to bubble up from time to time, but calls for more specific law to manage the problem have gone unheeded. 

Drawing on interviews with child welfare professionals and campaigners who work at national level, and on an analysis of policy, campaigning and educational documents, I explore how the issue is constructed, responded to and resisted as a social problem. I conclude that this is an example of an 'unconstructed' social problem because, despite continued public and professional concern, there has been no clear legislative response. Understanding how and why some social problems 'fail' is a key contribution to the literature on the social construction of social problems, which has focused mainly on 'successful' social problems to date.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>The a1-Antichymotrypsin  -51bp Promoter Polymorphism; Functional Activity and its Role in Alzheimers Disease</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Ritchie, Alistair Edward</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>WT Geriatrics. Chronic disease</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>There is biochemical evidence that the acute phase protein, a1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), is involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia.  Inflammation increases the level of ACT in the plasma, and it has been suggested that AD provokes chronic neuroinflammation.  One of the key proteins in AD is beta-amyloid which associates with ACT in the senile plaques characteristic of AD.  Studies to demonstrate a genetic association between polymorphisms in the ACT gene and AD have, to date, been inconclusive and contradictory.  The discovery, in our laboratory, of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of ACT suggested a new marker to test for a genetic association between ACT and AD.
To determine if the ACT promoter polymorphism had a functional effect which could modify the risk of AD, the promoter region was cloned into reporter constructs and transfected into mammalian cells in culture.  These included hepatocytes, astrocytes, neuronal cells and mixed population neural cells, and these were stimulated with oncostatin M.  In astrocytes, the T allele of the promoter allele demonstrates 208% and 146% higher activity than the G allele under basal and stimulated conditions, respectively.  In neuronal cells these values are 37% and 46%.  Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated differences in binding affinity of a DNA-binding protein, probably TFIIB, and the two alleles of the ACT promoter polymorphism.  However, an analysis of ACT promoter genotypes in AD cases (n= 389) and controls (n= 335) revealed no significant difference in the distribution of genotypes between cases and controls (p= 0.250), nor did any ACT promoter genotype appear to modify the age of onset of AD (p= 0.997).  The association between the ACT -51bp polymorphism and early onset AD was not investigated, due to the small number of EOAD cases in the population studied.

        <dc:title>Inherited factors in pre-eclampsia: Molecular genetic and epidemiological studies in a Sri Lankan population
</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Dissanayake, Vajira Harshadeva Weerabaddana</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>WQ Obstetrics</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Pre-eclampsia is a disorder of unknown aetiology that affects about 5% of Sri Lankan women during their pregnancy. It is most likely a multifactorial disorder that is caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Recent advances in genetics have resulted in a surge of investigations into genetic factors underlying pre-eclampsia. These studies have been conducted mainly in the white Caucasians in the West and the Japanese in the East. 

The investigations described in this thesis therefore were undertaken in a genetically distinct South Asian Sinhalese population in Sri Lanka and replicated in a white Caucasian population in Nottingham, UK. Four candidate genes; Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and Transforming Growth Factor Alpha (TGFA), which may play a role in placentation; Angiotensinogen (ANG), which is involved in blood pressure regulation; and 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), which is an enzyme involved in folate metabolism, were examined.

These investigations consisted of the following: Recruitment of 80 population volunteers each from the Sinhala, Sri Lankan Tamil and Moor racial groups in Sri Lanka, establishing the allele/haplotype frequency for the candidate genes in those volunteers and in 80 white Caucasian population volunteers, and comparing their allele/haplotype frequencies; recruitment of 180 Sinhalese women with pre-eclampsia and 180 normotensive pregnant Sinhalese women, establishing the allele/haplotype frequencies of the candidate genes in these women and in 74 white Caucasian women with pre-eclampsia and 81 normotensive pregnant white Caucasian women, comparing the pre-eclampsia phenotype of the Sinhalese with that of the white Caucasians, examining the association of the candidate genes with pre-eclampsia, and examining the association of the candidate genes with quantitative traits such as birth weight and blood pressure in normotensive pregnant women; and examining the functional effects of polymorphisms in the angiotensinogen gene on gene expression.

The phenotyping results of the Sinhalese women reflect the severe morbidity associated with pre-eclampsia elsewhere, and highlight the severe perinatal mortality associated with pre-eclampsia in the Sinhalese. The population genetic results show considerable similarity between allele/haplotype frequencies of the Sri Lankan racial groups and considerable variation between them and the white Caucasians. The EGF gene was associated with pre-eclampsia in the Sinhalese and with the weight of babies at birth in both the Sinhalese and the white Caucasians. The TGFA, ANG and MTHFR genes were not associated with either pre-eclampsia or any quantitative trait. The angiotensinogen reporter gene expression studies revealed the possible existence of a repressor element in the 3' untranslated region of the angiotensinogen gene, but this finding needs confirmation by further investigations.

        <dc:title>Classical and Quantum Causality in Quantum Field Theory, or, "The Quantum Universe"</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Eakins, Jonathan Simon</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QB Astronomy</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Based on a number of experimentally verified physical observations, it is argued that the standard principles of quantum mechanics should be applied to the Universe as a whole. Thus, a paradigm is proposed in which the entire Universe is represented by a pure state wavefunction contained in a factorisable Hilbert space of enormous dimension, and where this statevector is developed by successive applications of operators that correspond to unitary rotations and Hermitian tests. Moreover, because by definition the Universe contains everything, it is argued that these operators must be chosen self-referentially; the overall dynamics of the system is envisaged to be analogous to a gigantic, self-governing, quantum computation. The issue of how the Universe could choose these operators without requiring or referring to a fictitious external observer is addressed, and this in turn rephrases and removes the traditional Measurement Problem inherent in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.

The processes by which conventional physics might be recovered from this fundamental, mathematical and global description of reality are particularly investigated. Specifically, it is demonstrated that by considering the changing properties, separabilities and factorisations of both the state and the operators as the Universe proceeds though a sequence of discrete computations, familiar notions such as classical distinguishability, particle physics, space, time, special relativity and endo-physical experiments can all begin to emerge from the proposed picture. A pregeometric vision of cosmology is therefore discussed, with all of physics ultimately arising from the relationships occurring between the elements of the underlying mathematical structure. The possible origins of observable physics, including physical objects positioned at definite locations in an arena of apparently continuous space and time, are consequently investigated for a Universe that incorporates quantum theory as a fundamental feature.

Overall, a framework for quantum cosmology is introduced and explored which attempts to account for the existence of time, space, matter and, eventually, everything else in the Universe, from a physically consistent perspective.</dc:description>

        <dc:title>The application of in situ AFM to the study of molecular and macromolecular crystallization</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Keel, Trevor</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QD901 Crystallography</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The crystallization of molecules from solution encompasses a number of key areas in science and technology, ranging from the purification and separation of industrial chemicals through to the arrangement of fragile biomacromolecules in ordered arrays suitable for structural analysis.  However, as there are only a small number of techniques suitable for the study of such assemblies, many fundamental aspects governing the crystallization of molecules from solution are still poorly understood.  In the studies presented here we have attempted to improve the understanding of this subject by investigating the crystallization of a series of molecules of both pharmaceutical and biological importance, using in situ Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).  A particular aim of the PhD was to develop the experimental protocols necessary to investigate macromolecular crystals known to exhibit poor diffraction properties, and subsequently to relate AFM data to these properties.
	
The first study carried out concerned the crystallization and habit modification of a pharmaceutical excipient molecule, adipic acid.  By using AFM we were able, for the first time, to directly observe the behavior of the dominant (100) face in both an air and liquid environment.  A number of important observations were made including solute reorganization in air, etch pit formation and growth inhibition by the structurally related habit modifier, octanoic acid.
We subsequently investigated various aspects of the crystallization of the model protein, lysozyme.  The rate and mechanisms of growth of the (110) surface of the tetragonal crystal were observed using in situ AFM at a range of supersaturations, a study that uncovered a previously unreported mechanistic event.  The (110) and (101) faces were then both investigated at higher resolution, revealing molecular resolution features corresponding directly to basic crystallographic data.

The polymorphic characteristics displayed by many macromolecular crystals were then investigated in a short study concerning the growth and structure of the monoclinic form of the lysozyme crystal.  The dominant (101) face of the crystal was investigated at both high and low protein/precipitant concentrations, allowing us to unambiguously distinguish between two crystalline forms of the same macromolecule.
Finally, by utilizing the experimental techniques developed throughout the previous studies, we investigated a poorly diffracting crystal constructed from a protein found in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Response Regulator 02 receiver domain (RR02rec).  By studying the surface of crystalline RR02rec with in situ AFM, we were able to uncover various features of the crystal lattice that may have contributed to the poor diffraction properties displayed by the crystal during previous X-ray studies. 

Besides revealing a range of new molecular scale details concerning the structure and growth of each of these crystal systems, these studies culminated in a successful attempt to relate direct microscopical observations of growth dynamics of a protein crystal system (RR02rec) to the limited results obtained from previous crystallographic studies performed on this protein. As an approach this offers considerable promise in identifying problems with certain crystals and, in conjunction with future advances in AFM technology, may offer information that could lead to the acceleration and enhancement of X-ray diffraction analyses.

        <dc:description>Extensive investigations have been made to try and understand the physical properties and structures of condensed DNA phases in vitro during the past decades (Bloomfield, 1991, Marquet and Houssier, 1991, Bloomfield, 1996). The packing pathways of DNA molecules are three dimensional processes, and are not yet fully understood (Yoshikawa et al., 1997). Distinguishing different single DNA molecules at different locales in time in the presence of condensating or dissociating agents is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of packing and unpacking of DNA molecules. The aim of this study is to provide an increased understanding of the some of the pathways of packing and unpacking of DNA. This aim was achieved by monitoring in time and at molecular scale the interaction between the DNA and polyamidoamine dendrimers, as condensating poly cations, and by observing the dissociation of some of these condensates in time when they were exposed to DNase I enzyme, as a dissociating in vivo agent. The main techniques used were atomic force microscopy (AFM) and gel electrophoresis. We believe that the results could be beneficial to the understanding of the in vivo condensation and dissociation process of certain DNA morphologies. 

Chapter 1 will focus on providing an overview of the single molecule techniques used, atomic force microscopy as a means of detecting individual biomolecules in near physiological conditions with time and its application in monitoring non-viral gene delivery systems on surfaces. Methods used for gene delivery, and the PAMAM dendrimers as one of the recently applied polymer in non-viral gene delivery are also reviewed.
The materials and methods used in this thesis were considered in chapter 2.

Chapter 3 will concentrate on the factors effecting the interactions of generation 4, 6 and 8 PAMAM dendrimers on surfaces. An understanding of these interfacial interactions is important to understand their effects on the individual DNA molecules. This aim was achieved by using AFM as an imaging and force measuring tool to visualize and characterize the adsorption of these dendrimers on mica, gold and on alkanethiol self assembled monolayers (SAMs). 

Developing a deep understanding of the adsorption of DNA onto oppositely charged substrates would be of fundamental importance in understand the packing and unpacking pathways of these molecules. This philosophy is demonstrated in Chapter 4 in which the ability of the monovalent cations to facilitate imaging of DNA, and the effect of these monovalent cations in the partial condensation of DNA is explored. In addition, Chapter 4 introduces DNA imaging in the presence of divalent cations in liquid and in air. 

The folding pathways of dendrimer-induced DNA condensation with time on the surface of mica in aqueous environment were the targets of Chapter 5. In addition, the surface-influenced DNA condensation in the presence and absence of sufficient soluble cations and the ionic strength dependence were also studied. Structural volume and hence information regarding the number of plasmid molecules in each condensate was explored. Furthermore, the effect of loading ratio and generation type on the complex retardation in gel electrophoresis was investigated. 
Chapter 6 investigates the different mechanisms of the DNA-PAMAM dendrimer condensate relaxation and fragmentation by DNase I with time and explores the mechanisms of wrapping and unwrapping of the DNA on the larger generations of dendrimers.

The final chapter, Chapter 7, discuses the progress made towards the aims of this thesis. Interestingly, this investigation is one of the first to apply atomic force microscopy operating in liquid to visualize at the molecular scale and in real time DNA molecules in the absence of multivalent cations, to explore the formation of DNA complexes with ethylene di amine PAMAM dendrimers that have real potential as gene delivery vectors and to investigate the different condensation and dissociation pathways of individual DNA molecules. 

Overall it is hoped that the work described in this thesis provides a step forward in the methods applied for AFM based nano-force biomolecular imaging with time and provides a valuable information that aid in developing a successful non-viral gene delivery system.

        <dc:title>Bayesian Inference for Stochastic Epidemic Models using Markov chain Monte Carlo Methods</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Demiris, Nikolaos</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QA276 Mathematical statistics</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>This thesis is concerned with statistical methodology for the analysis of stochastic SIR (Susceptible-&gt;Infective-&gt;Removed) epidemic models. We adopt the Bayesian paradigm and we develop suitably tailored Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. The focus is on methods that are easy to generalise in order to accomodate epidemic models with complex population structures. Additionally, the models are general enough to be applicable to a wide range of infectious diseases.

We introduce the stochastic epidemic models of interest and the MCMC methods we shall use and we review existing methods of statistical inference for epidemic models. We develop algorithms that utilise multiple precision arithmetic to overcome the well-known numerical problems in the calculation of the final size distribution for the generalised stochastic epidemic. Consequently, we use these exact results to evaluate the precision of asymptotic theorems previously derived in the literature. We also use the exact final size probabilities to obtain the posterior distribution of the threshold parameter $R_0$.

We proceed to develop methods of statistical inference for an epidemic model with two levels of mixing. This model assumes that the population is partitioned into subpopulations and permits infection on both local (within-group) and global (population-wide) scales. We adopt two
different data augmentation algorithms. The first method introduces an appropriate latent variable, the \emph{final severity}, for which we have asymptotic information in the event of an outbreak among a population with a large number of groups. Hence, approximate inference can be performed conditional on a ``major'' outbreak, a common assumption for stochastic processes with threshold behaviour such as epidemics and branching processes.

In the last part of this thesis we use a \emph{random graph} representation of the epidemic process and we impute more detailed information about the infection spread. The augmented state-space contains aspects of the infection spread that have been impossible to obtain before. Additionally, the method is exact in the sense that it works for any (finite) population and group sizes and it does not assume that the epidemic is above threshold. Potential uses of the extra information include the design and testing of appropriate prophylactic measures like different vaccination strategies. An attractive feature is that the two algorithms complement each other in the sense that when the number of groups is large the approximate method (which is faster) is almost as accurate as the exact one and can be used instead. Finally, it is straightforward to extend our methods to more complex population structures like overlapping groups, small-world and scale-free networks

        <dc:title>Prediction of elastic behaviour and initial failure of textile composites</dc:title>

        <dc:subject>TA Engineering (General). Civil engineering (General)</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>When a component is produced from textile reinforcement, it is well known that the reinforcement conforms to the shape of the tooling, predominantly by in-plane shear deformation.  Current structural analysis techniques for composite components frequently neglect the effects of this deformation on subsequent mechanical properties.  In this thesis the effects of shear deformation in the reinforcement on mechanical properties of the composite are shown to be significant, both for flat laminates with uniform reinforcement deformation, and for a component where deformation changes over the geometry.

Methods are developed to predict the elastic behaviour and initial failure of components manufactured from textile reinforced composites, giving consideration to reinforcement deformation.  One of the main objectives is to employ techniques which are purely predictive wherever possible, such that experimental test data are required principally for validation, rather than as input to the models.  Implementation is performed in a modular fashion such that alternative models may be substituted at any stage in the procedure without affecting subsequent stages.

Micromechanics models are employed to predict the properties of unidirectional composites from fibre and matrix properties and experimental validation is performed.  A failure criterion is employed to determine lamina failure under biaxial loading.  A simple model for woven fabric stiffness is implemented and extended to predict failure.  Classical laminate theory is used to predict elastic and failure behaviour of angle-ply laminates; predictions are subsequently validated against experimental data.  Material property and compaction models are incorporated into a draping simulation software tool which is used to create input files for structural analysis of components using layered shell finite elements, thought to be the most rigorous technique for textile composite components published to date.  Results are shown to agree well with experimental data.

To give full consideration of reinforcement geometry, initial studies of finite element modelling of the repeating unit cell are performed, whereupon the benefits and disadvantages of this technique are highlighted.

        <dc:description>Nogalamycin is a member of the anthracycline family of antitumour antibiotics.  These are potent cytotoxic agents and are routinely used in cancer chemotherapy.  Though nogalamycin is clinically insignificant, it does exhibit three distinct types of non-covalent binding to DNA.  Since most other anthracyclines bind to DNA by only one or two of these mechanisms, nogalamycin is an excellent model with which to probe the interaction of this class of anti-tumour agents with DNA.

Here, we investigate the binding orientation and stoichiometry of nogalamycin in adjacent TpG(CpA) (and CpG(CpG)) intercalation sites using a combination of NMR techniques and NOE-restrained molecular dynamics simulations.  These methods are also employed to investigate the structure of GNA hairpin loops, which are considered to have important biological functions, and assess how their structure and stability are influenced by the introduction of nogalamycin at an adjacent site.  The effect of nogalamycin on extrahelical thymine bases incorporated onto either face of the intercalation sites is also investigated in this context.

Binding of quadruplex-specific antibodies to telomeric DNA in Stylonychia lemnae macronuclei has recently been detected using immunofluorescence, providing direct evidence for the formation of quadruplex DNA structures in vivo.  Guanine-rich quadruplex structures have been extensively studied by NMR and x-ray crystallographic methods.  Previous structural studies have failed to unambiguously resolve the conformation preferred by less-stable A-tetrads incorporated into DNA quadruplexes.  Additionally, little effort has been made to address the exact number of ions bound to these adenine-containing structures.  This forms the basis of our study into quadruplex DNA.

Finally, we endeavour to investigate the extent of hydration of both duplex and quadruplex structures using rMD methods, and to comapre hydration patterns in the liquid- and solid-state.

        <dc:title>Managing radioactively contaminated land: a method to assist the design of long-term remediation strategies</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Cox, Glen Michael</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>TD Environmental technology. Sanitary engineering</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>This thesis describes the development of a system to assist the design of long-term remediation strategies for radioactively contaminated land. Existing radiological models, that estimate the uptake of radionuclides by plants and the doses arising from exposure to external radiation, were combined with a spatially implemented food-chain model, to allow the temporal and spatial variation of radionuclide transport through the terrestrial environment, and the resulting doses of exposed human populations, to be estimated. Doses are estimated using a novel method for the simulation of human populations, which includes the generation of sub-populations by Monte-Carlo sampling and consideration of the geographical origins of consumed food products. Various simulated radiological countermeasures have been incorporated into the system (e.g. clean-feeding of livestock), allowing the effects of potential remediation strategies to be assessed. Furthermore, a method has been developed which efficiently identifies the optimum set of countermeasures for a given scenario according to a defined merit function using cost benefit analysis, which can be extended to include terms that account for the preference for averting high levels of individual dose, and the social costs of a number of countermeasure side-effects (e.g. disruption of normal daily life). 

To assess the applicability of the system, it was used to evaluate potential remediation strategies for hypothetical, large-scale nuclear accidents within two contrasting case study sites (Cumbria, UK and Zaragoza, Spain). In both case studies the system successfully identified optimal remediation strategies which were, according to the defined merit function, significant improvements upon simple food and dose rate restriction strategies.

        <dc:title>Investigating the fundamentals of drug crystal growth using Atomic Force Microscopy</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Thompson, Claire</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QD901 Crystallography</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>The importance of crystals to the pharmaceutical industry is evident - over 90% of pharmaceutical products contain a drug in crystalline form. However, the crystallization phenomena of drug compounds are poorly understood. An increased understanding of these processes may allow a greater degree of control over the crystallization outcomes, such as morphology, purity, or stability. In these studies, we have applied Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to the in situ investigations of drug crystal growth. 

We utilized AFM to assess the growth on the (001) face of aspirin crystals at two supersaturations, elucidating both the growth mechanisms and kinetics at each supersaturation. We also investigated the nucleation of aspirin crystals, using microcontact printing to arrange aspirin-binding and non-binding self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) onto surfaces. This facilitated the visualization, using AFM, of the growth of aspirin crystals adhered to the surface. Additionally, secondary nucleation was observed on the growing crystals.  

The effect of the additives acetanilide and metacetamol on the morphology and growth on the (001) face of paracetamol was investigated. The presence of metacetamol significantly reduced the growth rate on the face, with respect to pure paracetamol solutions. The growing steps exhibited a pinned appearance, consistent with the Cabrera and Vermilyea model. Conversely, acetanilide caused dissolution to occur. 

Finally, we assessed the capabilities of AFM in following the structural transformations of crystals, which can occur in unstable pharmaceutical compounds. We employed AFM to determine the process by which anion exchange, and the subsequent structural transformations, of the co-ordination polymers {[Ag(4,4'-bipy)]BF4} and {[Ag(4,4'-bipy)]NO3} occur. AFM data verified that the anion exchange process is solvent-mediated. The mechanisms underlying this process are discussed herein. 

These results reiterate the capability of AFM to monitor dynamic events on crystal surfaces. Analogous studies could be applied to numerous pharmaceutical compounds, thus facilitating the optimization of their crystallization parameters. In essence, future experiments using AFM may afford greater control over crystallization, and prevent the production of unwanted or unstable pharmaceutical compounds.

        <dc:title>Tellurite And Fluorotellurite Glasses For Active And Passive Fibreoptic Waveguides</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>O'Donnell, Matthew David</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>TA1501 Applied optics. Phonics</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>Glasses systems based on TeO2-ZnO-Na2O (TZN), TeO2-WO3, and TeO2-Na2O-ZnF2 are reported here, with a number of other components added (PbO, GeO2, Nb2O5, Bi2O3, Er2O3, Yb2O3, PbF2, and ErF3). 

Glass formation was shown for the first time, to this author's knowledge, in the ternary system (90-x)TeO2-10Na2O-xZnF2 for x = 5 to 30 mol. %. Glass stability (Tx-Tg) was found to increase with ZnF2 addition, reaching a plateau of around 161oC at x = 25 mol. %. This could be due to competition of various phases to crystallise (NaZnF3 and Zn2Te3O8) as the eutectic is approached, with fluoride addition. These glasses are the most stable ZnF2 containing tellurite compositions reported to date, to the author's knowledge.

As-received ZnF2 batch material was shown to contain a significant proportion of Zn(OH)F, identified by XRD. The as-received ZnF2 was fluorinated with (NH4)HF2, which produced a substantially more phase pure powder, with oxygen levels reduced from around 13.2 to 3.1 at. % from XPS spectra. By calculation from the O1s XPS peaks, the proportion of Zn(OH)F was reduced in the powders from 39.7 to 9.4 mol. %.

A number of absorption bands in the infrared were identified by FTIR for the TeO2 -ZnO-Na2O glasses due to intrinsic lattice vibrations (visible in a 0.2 mm sample), and extrinsic impurity absorption, including: free OH (around 3.0 microns, 3300 cm-1), weakly hydrogen-bonded OH (around 3.3 microns, 3060 cm-1), and strongly hydrogen-bonded OH (around 4.8 microns, 2090 cm-1).

For the series (90-x)TeO2-10Na2O-xZnF2, mol. %, x = 5 to 30 mol. % melted for 2 hours as bulk glasses, OH bands at 2900 cm-1 were reduced in intensity with ZnF2 addition due to self drying of the melt, from around 0.12 cm-1 (120 dB.m-1) for x = 5 mol. %, to around 0.02 cm-1 (20 dB.m-1) for x &gt; 15 mol. %. Melting time also had a significant effect on drying of this series, with the loss at 2900 cm-1 reduced by two orders of magnitude when increased from 1 hour (around 705 cm-1, 705 dB.m-1) to 2 hours (0.01 cm-1, 10 dB.m-1). Refractive index of the series (90-x)TeO2-10Na2O-xZnF2, mol. %, x = 5 to 30 mol. % decreased linearly with ZnF2 addition, from 2.02 (x = 5 mol. %) to 1.85 (x = 30 mol. %), as the fluoride and zinc are less polarisable than oxygen and tellurium.

Cohen-Grest viscosity modelling was used to predict the fibre drawing temperature (around 330oC, corresponding to a viscosity of 10^4.5 Pa.s), and fragility of the fluorotellurite core / clad pair (20 / 25 mol. % ZnF2), occurring at least 60oC &lt; Tx. Fragility of these glasses was predicted to lie between oxide tellurite glasses (stronger) and fluorozirconate glasses (more fragile).

Increasing melting time and fluorination resulted in a significant decrease in OH bands in the 700 nm to 2.5 micron region for unstructured 70TeO2-10Na2O-20ZnF2 mol. % fibre, from around 40 to 4 dB.m-1 at 2.5 microns as melting time was increased from 3 to 10 hours. Fibre optical loss for the 10 hour melt was relatively flat (around 5 dB.m-1) over the entire 700 nm to 2.5 micron region.</dc:description>

        <dc:description>Natural ventilation has the potential to provide good indoor air quality, thermal comfort for occupants, and can also save energy and reduce CO2 emissions.  Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) offers detailed information about indoor flow patterns, air movement, temperature and local draught distribution in buildings, so it has unique advantages as an efficient and cost-effective tool for optimum design in a complex built environment.
This thesis shows the use of CFD to simulate the coupled external and internal flow field around a 6m cubic building with two small openings.  To study both wind driven and combined wind and buoyancy driven cross ventilation through a full-scale cubic structure, un-structured grid CFD and a steady envelope flow model were applied to calculate mean ventilation rates.  To validate the CFD results, full-scale experiments were undertaken under various weather conditions in England.  
For wind driven ventilation RANS model predictions were proved reliable when wind directions were near normal to the ventilation openings, i.e. 0o~30o.  However, when the fluctuating ventilation played a more dominant role than the mean flow (90o) RANS models were incapable of predicting the total ventilation rate.  Improved results may be expected by applying more sophisticated turbulence models, such as LES, weighted quasi-steady approximations, or unsteady envelope flow models.  In the thesis experience on the modelling of combined wind and thermal effects is outlined and feedback is provided to CFD code developers to enable further improvements for building ventilation studies.  The full-scale field testing data from this study is valuable for comparison with wind tunnel results and validation of CFD applications.

        <dc:title>BURST Imaging at High Field</dc:title>
        <dc:creator>Wilton, Benjamin</dc:creator>
        <dc:subject>QC501 Electricity and magnetism</dc:subject>
        <dc:description>BURST is a fast single-shot imaging technique used in magnetic resonance imaging.  Most previous implementations of BURST on whole body systems have been carried out at fields of 1.5T and lower.  In this work BURST has been implemented on a 3T whole body system.  The signal and attenuation characteristics are discussed, leading to an approximate expression for the optimum echo time.

A novel method for controlling the pulse amplitude envelope is described.  It is shown that this can lead to a modest gain in signal with little loss of resolution, or to a much greater gain in signal with more severe blurring of the image.

Frequency modulated RF pulses have been introduced in order to reduce the peak RF power required, which was found to be beyond the range of a 2kW amplifier.  The resulting images show a quadratic phase roll in the readout direction, with no reduction in magnitude or image artefacts.  A reduction in peak power of more than ten-fold is demonstrated.  The maximum reduction factor possible is shown to be approximately equal to the number of pulses applied in the RF train.

The total RF power has been reduced by superimposing a sinusoidal oscillation onto the constant excitation gradient.  Each pulse is applied at a gradient minimum, and hence need be of lower bandwidth, while the overall excitation is unchanged.  The RF pulses are transformed using VERSE.  A reduction in SAR of 32% is demonstrated.  Greater reductions can be achieved by increasing the amplitude of the oscillation.  However, this technique introduces a moderate amount of acoustic noise into the sequence.
